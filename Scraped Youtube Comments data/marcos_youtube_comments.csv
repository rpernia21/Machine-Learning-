I don't regret voting him. Been a silent supporter for a long time and was questioning myself if it is right to stay quiet even if people are throwing, calling them all the bad names in the world. But when he says that ""I have advantage because I know the Truth"" , it made me realize that I did the right thing. Staying quiet and doing nothing doesn't mean your weak, it's just that you know better and you're just doing the right thing than being violent towards your countrymen. God Bless the Philippines and all the Filipinos.

I'm a Marcos hater then. Since my early childhood I was exposed hearing my father (RIP)and his friends talking about how bad Marcos then. Mga 9 yrs pa lang ako noon and I was not aware then that my father was a member/symphatizer of Hukbalahap syempre that time leftist sila. Nakalakihan ko na ang hatred against Marcoses. I was working in abroad when the hstoric and fateful day, EDSA People's Power erupted. I cried tears of joy seeing those people marching and staying in the streets and more so when Marcoses left the palace. I went home to Philippines and with great hope I applied for work in Malacanan and was hired in RTVM (Presidential Broadcast Staff) Close-on kami ni Tita Cory noon at immuned kami sa mahigpit ng security ng PSG tuwang-tuwa ako noon kasi nakakalapit kami shoulder to shoulder with the president. Then, as ime passed working with RTVM I realized what they were doin. We were told and assigned to do black propagandas against Marcos who at that time matagal ng patay and the family was no longer in power. Naisip ko ano ang saysay ng gingawa namn matagal ng patay si Apo Lakay binubugbog pa namin! I resigned, that was the time I changed my heart. Naisip ko peaceful naman noon kahit may martial law at naisip ko rin na kung di ka naman gumagawa ng masama e bakit ka i-presecute ng gobyerno. We, our family voted for BBM! Happy to see them back. Malacanang Redemption!

Totoo talaga yung sinabi ni BBM, na nawala nating mga Pilipino ang pagiging proud sa nationality natin. Satingin ko dahil yan sa mga napapanood natin mula nung bata tayo. Karamihan ng balita na maririnig patungkol sa ating bansa ma pa radyo man o TV ay masama. Onti onti tayong namuhi sa ating pinagmulan. Kaya hindi natin masabi sa buong mundo na ako ay proud Pilipino. Sana nga maibalik natin ito upang maging isang totoong nasyon ulit tayo.

Naabutan ko pa ang panahon ng dad mo and i can say life before was so so much better. Everything was cheap, from electric bills down to basic needs. My parents are govt employees but i can say na hindi sila hirap noon and all praise sila sa magandang pamamalakad noon.

I understand the luxury play of Marcos Sr. -He's trying to represent the Philippines to other countries that filipinos are not small and he stood up with Elegancy, Alpha Male. That they should come visit, do business and prosper together with the Philippines as the center. That was destroyed when small people with lack of vision provoked and misunderstood his play. We hoped to be a great Country again and many of us are here to support our new great president. May you be blessed with more wisdom as we welcome your family back and lead our Country.

Nakakaiyak, this video was taken last year, and when Ms Toni asked, ""where do you see yourself next year?"" and pops said still in public service kasi it's never finished, and here we are today year 2022 - President ka na po namin  Grabe Yung way ni Lord.

now I know why the opposition would hate this interview, is because it humanized the senior Marcos, and the junior Marcos as a real, genuine person.
this interview was beyond excellent..the answers were absolutely perfect, concise and delivered in a very Marcosian way

I didn't vote this last election. I was  born 3 years after the Martial Law. I really don't care about Politics since I've experienced no significant changes during the past administration (except for Duterte). Heard a lot of stories about your family- good and bad. 
Please make our country the Pearl of Asia again. Where no one will ever look down on us again like what your father did. Protect the OFW, children and all the Filipino people.

I remember when we were kids, we wear red clothes and learn the peace sign as showed being supporters of Marcos. We grew up with our Grandparents saying Marcos is best leader of Philippines and the life of Filipinos then is way better and Dollar exchange is not high compared now. It's about time to have a good leader again.

I (an OFW based in UK) was approached by an old woman and asked: ""Are you a Filipino?"" - Yes (of course, diba). She said ""You know, I lived in the Philippines for 4 years back when Marcos was the president. And now, Marcos is back again."" You can feel the warmth and joy from her words.

Mabuhay ka Apo BBM!!!  We will never forget your father's kindness and generosity to us military families.  Your father was good to soldiers and my late father remained loyal to your father until the day he died.  Kasi po, kung hindi dahil sa mga benepisyong binigay ng tatay nyo ay matagal na po kaming namatay sa gutom.  Totoo po iyan. God bless you and I wish you success as the new president of the Philippines.

As a first-time voter who voted last May 9, 2022, as well as someone who knows the truth about the Marcoses, it made me cry kasi the young people who's as old as me (or even younger than me) are part of the haters of his family kasi they believed in the repeated lies, which became the truth today. I have always saluted the perseverance of Pres. Marcos Sr., especially during the time when the opposition yearned for his step-down. How I wish the young people knew the truth about who the Marcoses really are, and not how they are depicted in history books, social media, and the news. Until now, I'm still so proud that I voted for Bongbong Marcos as the next president of the Republic of the Philippines. Marcos Forever!

I personally like how he speaks. He seems like a person na kapupulutan ng aral. Wise. Iba kasi eh. There's something about his aura showing that he's truly intelligent. Tung tipong hindi pilit. Hindi pinangangalandakan. Natural. Walang bahid ng kaplastikan. Panahon na para mas lalaong yumabong ang mahal nating bansa. He is clear about what he wants for the country. He is not busy trying to pin down other ""enemy"" candidates unlike what others are doing. He is focused on his vision. I can imagine, he might be strict but it will be for the best. We all have this chance to choose this incredible man and change the course of our nation. I've always been embarassed when friends from other country asks me where I'm from. I never wanted to say I was Filipino. I gained back the sense of pride when PD30 sat on the position. Now I'm more than ready to raise our flag again. I am excited for the day I can fully and proudly say I am Filipino.

I am happy because with this simple interview, this is where the freedom of Filipinos from lies begins. We have long been mired in poverty and problems, and I see this as one of the ways for everyone to know that not everything a good person says is true. It is unfortunate because the debate and asking for sympathy from the people is repeated just to cover up the lies, so that the truth will also come out. It may take years but the real story will come out so I‚Äôm happy. I enjoy listening to stories from aunts, uncles and even my grandmother about how highly foreigners think of our country. Good things done by the Marks and things that prove we can do something. It is unfortunate because those who have not experienced Martial Law, they are still the activists who become the branch to spread more lies. The truth will really come out and it is already happening. You are my vote in the coming election. With or without an interview.

Went back to watch this Video as it shows how genuine He is. I watched all the interviews or documentaries for BBM whether it be from His critics or supporter. I noticed that the critics shows negative side and does not see how good he is. I understand that being a critic is showing the negative part of someone. Yet it should also be transparent and show the good side of the subject. So it can be called constructive criticism so that we can get better result from the documentaries/interviews. Thank you for this interview Miss Toni Gonzaga for showing his side and his personality.

Toni G you're indeed an example of a person of   good character and wisdom...i admire your kind of behavior which typifies a real filipina in the field of journalism and public discussion. You profess a well-educated and disciplined public icon in tv and elsewhere in other platforms. As a senior citizen and was born in FEM time i can definitely say that was the best time of my life. FEM had really instituted true discipline and love of our country whichbis exactly the opposite of his adversaries who wanted communism. i am proud to say that i am a product of Marcos era who lived in peace and harmony...where food is richly available at reasonable and affordable prices. i like his style of governance compared to the presidents of EDSA revolution who had duped the filipino youth of false accusations of the Marcos family. If FEM is not good for the agitators who had dabbed him as dictator, so be it. But young Marcoses should not be blamed for the father's misgivings.

I like the comfort that he feels in this interview.. no stuttering nor stammering, simply because he trusts Toni.. he knew that the interview will not be biased.. Toni asks questions same as the other interviewers do making sure that the words she'll use will not sound like she's interrogating him.. rather, she made sure that the interview will be more conversational in a professional way..

What the elect president BBM is absolutely true about how the Filipinos become known as from the Philippines. I remember my first year in the US when I was asked what nationality I was and I said I‚Äôm a Filipino from the Philippines and that person said where‚Äôs that at then later Philippines became known because of the late President Ferdinand Marcos being heard an intelligent and smart.

This is the only 2022 Candidate who doesn't need to say something against his opponents or backlash people who purposely wage vendetta over marcosses. He is the only 2022 Candidate that never looked down on filipino people -- he did see our potential, he don't pity us! His intention is to unleash the bestest in every life of filipino people. Isn't it amazing that this man didn't use flowery words to seek attention but simply stated the whole truth?

I didnt vote you as my President pero one thing is for Sure, meron Plano ang Diyos para sa Pinas kaya ikaw ang Nilagay niyo to Lead, Napaka sarap lang rin Pakinggan how you Uplift the Word Filipino or Pinoy na you'll feel its your Pride, the way you talk also is very Genuine and you'll see a Vision on Him his plans for the Philippines, God bless your Leadership and God be with you President BBM.

Therefor, the more engage yong isang leader sa community mas lumalawak yong kanyang pag iisip about the social issues and concerns and eventually come up with something to address them. Kaya sana may ipalabas na batas , election gudiance na dapat yong tatakbong official ng gobyerno is yong may community engagement hindi lang isa, dalawa, tatlong taon but more the better.

True Leaders are rare in this world. PBBM is right there is so many critics being in public service even in private life as well, either you do good people are still looking the negative output and it is normal in being human. Even in Bible history one of the great leader King David also have negative criticism. It doesn't mean they are perfect they also have shortcomings. But looking forward and leave the past behind is a best ethics every person must have we learn from it. We cannot turn back time and we still have future ahead of us to be more productive and be optimistic even in hard times... Just never give up and trust God for change...

May I encouraged you to include Mendiola Massacre, Hacienda Luisita Massacre, and Kidapawan Massacre in your exhibit! Hearing their stories will also be inspirational for your intended patrons than displaying only those of the Marcos regime. These are stories that institutions like you should strive to popularize and disseminate as well, as you are (supposed to be) exemplary models of how we can strive to create a better country for everyone.

Considering it is my first time to vote, my heart and decision as a youth will greatly affect my future. You have my vote sir! I remember when I was in 9th grade puro negative ang naririnig ko ab Martial Law hindi ko alam kung ano ba dapat yung paniwalaan so I ask my lola kasi naabutan niya yung panahon ni Marcos. Tinanong ko siya lola bakit nakakatakot daw noong Martial Law? And the only thing I remember what my lola said is that matakot ka kung may mali kang nagawa at against ka sa pamahalaan"" Kaya siguro puro paninira sila ngayon kay BBM dahil natatakot sila. I hope he could continue the unfinished legacy of his late father. And that is making the country better. You have my vote sir!

Congratulations for your courage to stand up high to fight for what you believe is right despite the criticisms and cancelling of your co artists. Mabuhay kayo Toni G and direk Paul.

Minsan depende nalang talaga sa Nagbabalita at sa Pananaw ng Nagbabalita.Kaya now i realized bago ako makinig sa mga Balita sa Telebisyon,Radyo at higit sa Social Media.Susubukan ko muna makita ang Katotohonan hindi lahat ng Balita ay totoo‚Ä¶Sabi nga Too see is what you believed.

I don't regret voting for him as President of the Philippines.  Also, among all the sitting Presidents in the Philippines or even in other countries, there are people who do not want him to be the president of the country.  His political opponent or those anti-supporters who hate him, they will do things that are not good for him and spread false news using social media or television to destroy the person they don't like.  As we always tell ourselves and the person we admire, WE ARE NOT PERFECT.

Batang 90's ako and di ko naabutan si former pres Marcos but I believe he was really the greatest leader of our country. Why? It's bcoz I don't ask but many people around testifies, spreads willingly thru their own voices, own experiences, people who had used to live under his seat that he had so many succesful projects for the philippines. That all the awful hearsays, bashes about the Marcoses, those that are transcribed from the books, boradcast in social media channels are very far, far  from the truth. Even my uncle who worked from Korea told me that he koreans looked ao high of the Filipinos during FM administration.

Ang masasabi ko lang he actually have a better plan for the country and ppl. I can feel his sincerity to serve us naman. I just hope ppl widen ther mindset and set aside muna ang hatred or anger at pakinggan ang side nila pero i'm not forcing anyone ha. Sana lang hindi masayang boto ng fam and relatives ko sainyo, they rlly adore and brag marcos family i swear.

All i can say is FED was the best president that the Philippines that we ever had next to PRRD . WHY?? Because when i left the Philippines in 1985 , the country was peaceful and quite and fully developed but when i went back in 1989 , it was so messy. PRRD put back what FED had started little by little . It is my honest convection that BBM will continue what his late father FED plans for the betterment of all the Filipios and our Motherland. BBM-INDAY SARA are the ""CHOSEN ONES"".

This interview have opened the eyes of Filipinos. BBM was truly humble public servant who never talk back against his critics. The last glance of his father FM was like telling BBM to continue the legacy of serving Filipinos and bringing to unity and nationhood. A salute to you President BBM God bless you!

I remember, months before the election. This is the first video I just watched about bong bong Marcos because I have no other idea who he really is aside from he's the son of first lady Imelda Marcos and former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr.  

And as this video goes minute by minute, I just realized something new when ever he talks and he talk humbly. Dun ako napa wow.  When he talks, he has no yabang in him. He speaks with his heart and telling a story of his family and experiences in a humble way. That's when the time I got curious more about BBM and I watch mostly of his interview, vlog etc. I just found myself he is very inspirational when it comes to speaking. He is a natural speaker. Wala talagang yabang and all.

This is 3rd time to watch this, hndi ko mapigil ang lumuha feel ko ang feeling ni sir BongBong ang about his father naiiyak nga din ako. Kahapon May 10 2022 1day after election. Marami akong narinig against sir Bong pero mas marami akong narinig na Likes and Loves to Marcos Family. Nakita ko sa infront ng comelec hndi nila matanggap ang pagiging loser pero mas marami ang nagdiriwang sa success as Pres.ni sirBong. Glory to God in the highest ! Kahit puyat nong bilangan magdamag masaya naman ang kalooban sa dami ng Prayer nila Bro.Mike Velarde , Pastor Apollo Quiboloy , mga Ministro at members ng INC mga Prayers ng mga supporters talagang aswered prayers tayo. The best quality of Pilipino nagdadamayan . Kahit matagal na itong interview na to marami at marami pa rin manonood sa ToniTalks channel na ito at mababasa nila ito. Panindigan Natin ang Katotohanan na si Sir Bong ay tinadhana ng Diyos para akayin tayong mga Pilipino tungo sa maayos na pamumuhay..wag tayo pasaway magsipag tayo sumunod sa batas ng tao at higit sa lahat sumunod sa batas ng Diyos lahat ng mga yan sa ikabubuti natin lahat.

I was not born on Marcos era, but I know that the late President Marcos was doing a very good job based on what he is done to the Philippines and other countries also knew about it. Also, I knew he's a good father, hearing from the stories of his own son. But sadly, some of us (Filipino people) doesn't know about it because of the lies and hatred from other people. And until now, even the youngest era of our time was manipulated by those lies. But seeing how President BBM manages all of this, I know that the truth will prevail because God have always fair judgement to good people.

My grandfather was the chief of staff of the army engrs during that time, its true that FM ordered them not to shoot anyone. I was brainwashed by history books that the school teaches, i didnt listen to my lolo. But everything he told about during Marcos Regime was true. I supported VP Leni since but I am so grateful that I was enlightened about the truth just a week before election. My husband is also a military officer, i grew up in a military home my grandfathers and uncles are military officers, PMA graduate, I married a PMAer too, I was the only Kakampink in thr family they are educating me about this but I did not listen, only a week before election that I was deeply thinking about it and I vowed to support my husband as well as thr government. I found out the truth about everything and I voted for BBM and Sara, now I am happy.

As a history teacher, I know that Marcos was the best president the PH ever had, but as time goes by, the history is changing and makes Marcos a bad guy, just the same, since I know the truth I keep on teaching the truth and I never used the textbooks that spread misinformation about Marcos as a great president, the new president is another Marcos, if my grandfather lives now he would be very happy too.

I think his dad's last look means something. And maybe that means his only hope is his son to continue the legacy he started; to make the nation great again and to save the Filipinos from poverty in God's will and time.  He probably wished that his junior will lead us and free us from the Yellowtards who poisoned our young minds.

marami sa pamilya ko military sa time ni president marcos halos lahat ng mga uncle ko at pati ang mga lolo ko nasa army kung hndi man nasa philippine constabulary (PC) totoo itong sinabi ni sir BBM na they ley down their arms. kwento ng mga uncle ko. saka yung plaza miranda bombing hndi yon pakana ng mga military ginawa yon ng mga komunista para mas magalit lalo ang mga tao kay marcos that time. nasa intelligence isang uncle ko noon alam nya mga totoong ng yari nung time ni marcos at patunay dyan si former senator juan ponce enrille mismo nag sabi na pakana ito ng mga komunista. napaka laki ng puso ni late president marcos sa mga pilipino at receiver din ng medal of valor si late president marcos in time of WWll he live,  he struggle,  and he die for the sake of pilipino people and thats the truth. no one can twist the truth lalabas at lalabas yan dahil madaming magpapa totoo nyan. until now.

It is really sad to say that no one continue his legacy.... He build and want his country to be known to the other countries.... I'm not interested in politics and I'm not born yet in his time, but if were talking about leadership, hard work and for the benefits to his country and fellow Filipinos, his the best President I've ever known.... And I don't know why they didn't teach and tell the truth in the school....

Wala ako masabi, kasi hindi pa ako ipinanganak non, pero naalala ko ang sabi ng tatay ko noong nabubuhay sya. Sa lahat ng prisedenteng nagdaan. Si marcos ang the best. Kaya hindi ako naniniwala na masama si marcos. Merong lang na mga taong naninira at gusto sila ang mamomono, kaya nga nila pinatay diba. Tapos kung ano ano pa ang mga paninora ang ginawa nila. Ganun talaga kahit bibliya. Nangyari na din ang ganyan. Kaya ang dapat gawin move on. Tanggapin ang katoto hanan na ang pinili ng Diyos parin ang magwawagi.

As he stated, he always tag along with his late father whenever they go out of the country for politics, don't you guys think his the best person to be our president? As his young age he is already exposed to this kind of environment, he even live at the palace when he was still 7.. kung OJT for president pa to.. sobra sobra na ang qualification niya.

some people will get mad at you for not being who they want you to be. one of the biggest forms of self-betrayal is living your life by their rules instead of your own. your task is simple: be kind, be real, be humble, keep growing and unapolegetically live your best life. YP

Iam just 26 at di pa ako buhay sa panahon ng mga marcos pero naikwento sa akin ng lola ko kung gaanu napakasaya mabuhay ng panahong namuno c ex president F. marcos kasi subrang napaka mura ng mga bilihin at madami pag kaka kitaan lahat ay sagana at walang mahirap bago paman dumating ang martial law Kaya lang naman nag ka martial law ay dahil sa mga nasa likod ng mga rebelde na ayaw ng tahimik na buhay at pilit na gustong umangat ng walang ka hirap hirap. Ang mga totoong utak talangka.at kaya lang naman madaming naabuso ang mga sundalo noong panahon ng martial law ay dahil sila rin ay naka tikim din ng mga pang aabuso sa kamay ng mga rebelde at di na hawak yun ni ex president F. Marcos kasi hindi nya kuntrolado ang bawat isang myembro ng sundalo. At sana naman wag puro bad side ng mga marcos ang tignan kasi naka lipas na yun at madami rin na gawang mabuti sa bansa si ex F. Marcos kung di lang naging gahaman sa kyamanan ang first lady emelda marcos sagana sana ang bansa ntin ngayon.pero kahit ganun paman naka lipas na ang lahat at ang mga naapektuhan at naabuso ng panahon ng martial law ay million million ang nakuha ng mga pamilya nila kaya sana naman mag move on na ang lahat sa usaping martial law. Hindi sa ako ay nag mama galing ako ay nag bibigay lang po ng opinion at nakikita ko na kailangan ng ating bansa ang magandang pamamalakad ng mga marcos nagawa na nya sa ilocos bakit d natin bigyan ng chance na baka magawa nya rin paunladin ang pilipinas,. Itigil na sana ang pambabatikos kasi matagal ng wala ang ex President F. Marcos at ang pag kakamali ng isa ay hindi pag kakamali ng lahat. Minsan kung sino pa ang masama sa tingin ng lahat ay sya pa pala ang may mabuting kalooban at totoong tao. Thank you toni G for this video vlog

My boss  met the first lady Imelda and Pres. Ferdinand way back the 70's and to my surprise, they have a lot of good things to say about them. They say a lot of good things about  how has been the Philippines  at that time. The couple daw is good looking especially madam Imelda a lot of people wanted to take pictures with them. The Marcos family may have many bad critics. But there are also people who would say good things about them and most have met them persnally, not by reading newspaper or heared from someone else.

Never in the interview did she ever praised or even discriminate the Marcoses. Even did she put Marcoses on the pedestal.

I was still young at that time but when my grandmother and mother told me about the time when Marcos was the president, their lives were prosperous. five cents you have a lot to buy, you already have rice and a dish, it's not difficult to travel, the fare is low, especially when you go home to the province. the pleasure of listening to hear a story during the time of marcos was like the pleasure of life back then, even if it was simple. I don't know why I'm crying over the story of senator bongbong, it's like I felt like the Filipinos were alive then. life prosperous and happy.

That being visionary is truly one of the best characteristics of being a great leader. No wonder Pres. Ferdinand Marcos is the best President that Philippines has ever had. Marcoses are the truest pure and kind hearted people. I can sense that they don‚Äôt have hatred to the people, but only the people who led and started the propaganda to instill hatred towards the Marcoses have made the people angry to them. It seemed the Marcoses were betrayed underground by using those influencial people especially religious sectors which that time were very persuasive.

None of this Politician make an effort or talk, they are all part of taking opportunity taking advantage of making rich of conspiracy business. I Thank all the people that works to make things learn and progress of showing the true makabayan. The country needs to be change completely from all levels. It is time for Bongbong to fulfill the long awaiting ambition of his Father for the Filipino to be a Maharlika. To Tony Gonzaga, you are really one of the best Blogger.

Toni: What's your best quality?
BBM:  It's against my nature (proceeds to laugh) 
Authentic humility at its finest   a true quality of a leader. Not once did I hear him speak highly of himself and speak ill against other people. Doesn't promote hate peddling unlike those dilawans/anti-Marcos/propagandists who did nothing but hate, point fingers, and dwell on the kuno ""dark side of history"". First of all the "" sins of the past"" during Martial Law has been proven FALSE time and time again. There were no cases filed for the missing people or ""tortured ones"". The Martial Law was declared because there were growing threats of terrorist attacks, people were out of control, the oligarchs were controlling the land reform, groups were conspiring against the president (including Sisa and Ninoy Aquino). The severity of the situation at that time was the reason why Martial Law was declared. Without that law, we would have been like Afghanistan‚Äîterrorists being our leaders. Cory Aquino and the dilawans controlled the media and has their propaganda, heck they fooled people into believing Marcos was a bad president I included but not anymore. It's about time the truth comes out. Not the truth written in the history books by the dilawans but the real one. Thank you, FEM for your service and authentic care for the Philippines and thank you in advance to President Bong Bong Marcos for making the Philippines great again.

The more you listen to BBM talk about his father, the more you admire how great his father, President Ferdinand Marcos was and how he established a wonderful family. I‚Äôm so saddened how the fellow Filipinos demonised, destroyed him and put him in so much pain until his last breath  He didn‚Äôt deserved it. It‚Äôs an eye opener really.

I remembered my late father cried when Pres. Marcos was ousted because of the false narratives by NPA/LP. They witnessed the real and true history of Martial Law, he said, ""if you are a law-abiding citizen you will live peacefully, and if you are against the law then you are in trouble"". Pres. Marcos was a WWII veteran hero same with my father who fought against oppressors (Japanese and communists), and they will always be our heroes.

They have good roads(which is not like today that repaired every election), the prices of necessities in the market and groceries were low, the cost of living before was not that high and bad, and there is a huge security and safety from NPAs.

The way Mr. BBM speaks is so sincere and it comes from his heart and mind, you can see how family Marcos loves all the Filipinos and our country as well, from what he shared, they never speak bad about their enemies, but instead they just focus on the work that needs to be done. Intelligent with the heart this is the kind of President that we need. #BBMismypresident2022 #votewisely.

She said that my lola got illness and needs an operation immediately but my lolo had no amount of money for the payment. He is only postman didn't had enough salary to pay the hospital bills. Because of his work, he decided to make a letter addressed to the office of the president and sent it to the office. After few weeks, my Lolo's  received the money. He was surprised that our president that time made an action on the letter. He is very thankful  because of that my lola's extend her life.

My parents left the Philippines during the Martial Law, we grew up here in the states. As growing up my thinking was that Marcos is a dictator portrayed by both Pinas and US mainstream media. After watching this interview and the backlash towards the host, it really dawn on me that the Marcoses are not bad at all. It showed that BBM's being a humble person. I think many doubters like myself had change my perception about the Marcoses. Thank to you Ms. Toni Gonzaga for that great interview. Mabuhay ang Pinas.

By far the best interview I‚Äôve ever seen. No bias, no malice, no hidden agendas. There are 3 versions of the truth, the Marcoses side, the other side and the real truth. Many, if not all of the cases against them reached the supreme court were dismissed due to lack of evidence. What‚Äôs wrong with BBM saying that we deserve better than to be treated as 2nd class citizens; That filipinos are the best; That we need discipline. Do not let your hate overwhelm your humanity (taken from BBM‚Äôs interview with Erwin Tulfo).

Isama mo na yung mga statements nung mga dating Anti. And parang wala akong napanuod na nag bad mouth mga Marcoses sa mga kumalaban sa kanila. Na engganyo tuloy ako magparehistro. I‚Äôm just hoping na ituloy ni BBM yung pagtakbo niya na presidente. He will definitely get my first ever vote.

I have grandfathers na part ng military time ng Marcos regime and they were always telling us stories of Marcos leadership.
Pero ang fave nilang ikwento yung time na handa na daw sila na pasabugin ang edsa but Marcos never gave them the go signal kahit pinipilit na ng chief of staff na pasabugin na, but it never came bec Marcos loved the Filipino people and would never wish harm to his countrymen.

‚ÄúI spent my whole life defending Filipinos I will not hurt them now‚Äù - President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos



I was able to watch Edsa 1 live telecast during that time.  I remember when Pres. Marcos was seating at the table and in front of him was then Chief of Staff Fabian Ver who was waiting for his instruction. Ver says they already got  two fighter planes flying now to strike at any time. However, Pres. Marcos order was not to attack. Even if there were lots of civilians gathered already, still his order was to disperse the crowd  without shooting them.  And if it is true that he was a dictator,  maybe those people who participated were long gone now.  And now, it's BBM's turn to prove his leadership!

Alam niyo napansin ko lang may isang ugali ang mga marcos o kahit si BBM lang, na hindi makuha ng karamihan satin lalo na ang mga kalaban niya sa politika. Yun ay ang maging laging kalmado sa lahat oras o hanggang kaya huminahon at kumalma, sobrang haba ng pasensya. Oo di ko inabot ang panahon ng tatay dahil bata pa rin ako 20yrs old only. Pero ayun ang pinaka napansin ko sa kanya since nung past 2016 election. Debate w/ other na running for VP laging kalmado kahit tirahan ng tirahin ng kalaban o kahit anong ibatong totoo man o hindi na sinasabi ng kalaban, kasi di natin alam ang nangyare noon katulad ko dko alam nangyare noon kasi syempre bata pa nga ako. Pero talagang nakukuha niya ang loob ng katulad ko kahit onti pa lang ang nalalaman ko, nababasa ko at nireresearch ko mga kabutihang ginawa nila sa bayan at bansa natin. Kahit mas marami ang nakikita at nababasa kong naninira sa kanila, ewan ko kung fake news ba o kwentong kutsero ba ang ibinabatong salita o binibintang sa kanila/pamilya niya. Pero still gustong gusto ko siya para sa bansa natin. Kumbaga kobinsadong kumbinsado ako sa kanya para manalo kahit ganon. Rehistrado nako nung 2019 at mag 21 this November at dati dko alam kung para saan at nagparehistro ako bilang botante, ngayon alam ko na kung para saan. Sa darating na eleksyon si sir Bongbong Marcos ang iboboto ko sa pagka presidente.

Mas naniniwala padin ako sa nanay ko at sa mga sinasabi ng matatanda. Minsan kase mas pinaniniwalaan naten yung sinasabi ng iba kesa sa nakikita ng ating mga mata. kaya ang ending hindi maganda. Binoto ko sya for VP nun pero hindi sya nanalo sana this time hindi sya dayain.

Nung Bata ko nabasa ko sa libro ng Araling Panlipunan na diktador daw po si late Ferdinand Marcos na masama daw siya. Kaya pag-uwi ko sa bahay nun tinanong ko ulit si lola at lola kung talagang masama nga si FM nuong siya ay presidente pero ang Sabi nila siya daw ang the best president Kasi nuon sobrang mura ng bilihin at may libre pa daw silang feeding. So Sabi ko kay lola bakit yung sa libro ganun ang sinasabi kay FM. At ngayon malaki na ako ngayon ko narealize na ang libro at media ay bias at di totoo mga sinasabi. This is a wake up call sa ating mga Pilipino na ang mga Marcos ang hindi magnanakaw at masama bagkus sila ang tunay na mabuti ang hinahangad sa ating mahal na Pilipinas. Kaya sir BBM kung tatakbo ka man po bilang Presidente next year nasa iyo po ang aking boto. I can see in your eyes the genuine and love for the Filipino people and the Philippines. Alam ko.magiging magaling kang presidente in the future katulad ng iyong yumaong ama. Kaya.please lang mga kapwa ko Pilipino iboto natin ang nararapat at tunay na may magandang hangad sa ating mga Pilipino.

You can see that Bongbong speaks with the use of memory and we all know that a person who speaks with the use of memories speaks the truth. He moves freely while he talks riding with the emotions that he remembered from his past which means that it really did happen. He is so soft hearted, gentle and kind in which traits that his father had taught him. VOTE FOR BBM TO BRING BACK PHILIPPINES BACK TO ITS FORMER GLORY!

Mirriam said, ""KEEPS STANDARDS HIGH IN CHOOSING A PRESIDENT."" and those qualities are: ""academic, professional and moral excellence."" and as we can see BBM has all of the three. Nakakatuwang isipin na boto si sen. Mirriam Santiago maging si Pres. Duterte kay BBM. Sana maging mulat at mapanuri ang mga Pilipino sa pag-boto ng magiging Presidente. Sana hindi yung presidenteng tumakbo lng dahil kinakalaban ang Marcos, hindi dahil gusto LANG tumulong sa mga mahihirap at hindi magpasikat lamang. Iboto ang taong may PANGARAP para sa ikakaunlad ng Pilipinas at sa ikabubuti ng mga mamamayan ng bansa.

Two of them speaks to impress. But the other one speaks to express without even bragging what they have accomplished in their lives. You can even tell who amongst them deserves to be the next leader of this country.

I‚Äôve been reading all the comments. It seems like Toni has made such a huge impact on how the Filipino people are going to vote this time. Thank you Toni for being the catalyst in this seemingly complicated issue on who to vote, especially because a lot  of the Filipino people vote according to who‚Äôs popular or trending ( hint: Pambansang kamao). 
I hope the Filipino people will vote wisely this time. I was born before Marcos became president in 1969. The country was great back then, and then the Coquangcos took over. However, it was revealed that the oligarchs of Tarlac were actually corrupt and were being portrayed as victims when they were, and still are, villains. Ask the tenants of their hacienda. They will tell you of the killings. It‚Äôs about time that we vote wisely. Bangon Pilipinas!!!

Habang pinapanood ko tong interview na to, isa lang ang sumagi sa isip ko. Yun ay yung napakadaming nasayang na panahon na sana naging mas better ang bansa, kung sana nabuksan na ang isip ng mga tao noon sana naging mas maayos tayo ngayon. Hindi ko naabutan ang panahon ni late Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, pero to think na hanggang ngayo  ay binabanatan pa din sya ng mga anti/kalaban nya ay isa lang ang ibig sabihin, naungusan nya lahat ng kalaban nya kaya galit na galit sa kanya or sa pamilya nya. Nakakalungkot lang kase nagpabulag ang karamihan noon sa panahon nya pero sabi nga lalabas at lalabas din ang katotohanan. Hindi pa huli ang lahat! BBM for President 2022!!!

Hindi ako mapolitics pero one of the reason nanood ako kc it's Toni who interviewed Sir BBM tsaka yung title talaga nakakaintriga.  Out of curiosity til now still watching on yt sa mga nagawa Ng Marcoses at naway andami palang hindi naisulat sa libro na nakakamanghang ginagawa ni Pres. Marcos para sa Pilipinas. Makatindig balahibo. (Bigla ko na explore vlogs, TikTok ni sir BBM at his fam are so fun and humble nila. Thank you for this mam Toni. Let's spread positivity guys.

Gnyan kalaki ang paninira na gingawa nla,  hnd ko naabutan ang panahon nya pero ung mga old citizens nlng mkpgssbi kung gaano kaunlad ang bansa ntin during his father's term.

May this be an example to all artists both in entertainment and news to always stand on you what you believe is right. I think Toni has anticipated already what's going to happen next after she publishes this episode. She has known the consequences but still, she has made this vlog possible because she believes it needs to be done. Not everyone has a strong spirit like hers. She is way more professional than anyone in this industry. Godspeed Toni!

Telling Toni who she should and shouldn't interview makes you no difference with the ""dictator"" you hate. I humbly ask you, people, to change your perspective. You live in a democratic country; all opinions and actions are considered, as long as it doesn't harm people. So as Toni, she has the right to do this. Let me tell you that Toni have also made an interview from the opposite party, VP Leny Robredo, and no one bashed and made such ridiculous petitions against her. Is that what you think of equality and democracy: a filtered system? It's making me mad how you call yourselves ""wokes"" when you have a very bad perception of a very simple, easy-to-understand, situation like this.

Ever since I got into ROTC, I never really fully believe what the books say about them. I mean how can we really believe with only one side of the story? Even the coin we are looking at has a different story. I always have this in my heart na ay may tinago to. Very biased lang kasi. I mean we don't really write a book and call it altogether factual if it's only one side of the story. It's always good to give a benefit of the doubt even if we are confronted with the truth. It's always good to step back for a while and see the whole thing with a different perspective.

The interview went well.  Politely, questions were answered smart, composed and with no drama.  This is a mere light conversation.  Toni Gonzaga handled it well, without pinpointing, accusing and pulling down the ""Marcos"" history. On the other hand, BBM answered the question direct to the point, without shaming or blaming others....
Simply, BBM wants to unite the nation again, he wants the Philippines great again and back to our own nationhood.  No body can answer the way BBM did in this interview. I commend you BBM and Toni.

This is not intended to be a hard hitting political take down piece. The interview was structured well by starting from when he was a child until his father‚Äôs death then segued into his vision for the future. She‚Äôs so good, the interview flowed seamlessly. His father‚Äôs ‚Äòsins‚Äô are not his sins. This is an interview about a son who loved his father. Who are we to judge? Great job Toni. Brilliant.

He is the Vice President of the late former Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago. With such intelligence and love for country, she chose BBM to be her Vice President for she knows his capabilities and potential. Give BBM a chance to help the Philippines. 

To the young ones, let us weigh things and think wisely. Vote wisely for our future depends on how we think. GOD BLESS THE PHILIPPINES! üáµüá≠

Ferdinand Marcos. The President who once made the country known as The Tiger of Asia, more progressive than Singapore  during his reign, respected by other countries, had many infrastractures where many of us are benefiting until now, who doesn‚Äôt read his speech and never boast on his achievements. 
Loyal Marcos until now.

I don't know why but this interview just made me cry. That ""final look"" that BBM was talking about really impacted me. You can see a man who genuinely talks about how great of a father and leader his dad was. Miss Toni really did it well. Her questions and Sir Bong's responses are very relevant and straightforward. Kudos!

BBM is compose and he speaks humbly. Very compose and tactful, aside from smart politician. Born with a heart for public service. What struck me is his nationhood idealogy. Time to be proud as Filipino again. Vote wisely!Praying for Philippines. BBM is the last card bringing up the good works of FEM. BBM for 2020 President! Thank you Jesus

I was crying not about politics, the way he follow his dad and the way he doesn‚Äôt understand why people hate his dad as young as 6. He have everything and his devotion to Filipinos is so great that until the very last he choose to protect what he have been protecting all his lifetime. It‚Äôs so sad to hear that last look you can see from your loved one passing away will be in him forever.

This is one of the best interview by miss Tony G. Naalala ko pa sabi ng mga parents ko ibang iba nung panahon ni Marcos. Walang maraming mahirap. At isa sa pinakamayamang bansa ang Pilipinas. Dahil ang piso nuong araw ay mahalaga marami kana mabibili pero ngayon san na aabot ang piso mo. At walang maraming nangingibang bansa nuon dahil mayaman ang Pilipinas nuong panahon ni Marcos.

I remember those times when my lolo and lola are still alive, lagi nilang pinagtatanggol sakin ang mga Marcos. I always hated our late President Ferdinand Marcos because that's what they taught us at school. Lagi akong nakikipagtalo sa mga grandparents ko noon one time nasabihan ako ng lola ko ""Wag mo akong turuan na parang nabuhay ka ng mga panahon ni Marcos, kami ang nakakita, kami ang nakasaksi"" then little by little I was enlightened and those learnings that I thought was true, it was all manipulated by those who won after Marcos. Grabe! Nung mga time na yun I felt like my whole childhood was a lie, I felt like I was cheated. But now, not anymore. Now I fully understand what my parents and grandparents are trying to tell me. Ngayon ang pangarap ko nalang maranasan din ang klase ng pamumuno na pinagmamalaki ng mga magulang at lolo't lola ko.

the way how he tell the story he amazed me. Hearing his side you feel its genuinely coming from his heart. Fact that everyone of us fools by the history. I agree everytime i asked my grandmother how was the marcos presidency? She was starring at me seriously! He was great and Philippines are number 1 in terms of exporting. Our country are rich in all form. Minerals, Skilled workers in short all the resources we already had. If i could bring back to that year i will choose him as my president. quoted See that how marcos did back in the century. I hope this time every Filipino would choose the visionary type of a leader and if BBM will run as president I will vote for him. The quality of a real leader i saw from him he was mold by his father experiences he had a point that you can never please anybody to like you. Toni thank you for sharing this kind of good content. Weve learned so much i hope for the success of your journey. Godbless

Just sharing.  I started being curious about the late Marcos  when I started working here in Manila . Probably  about 3x a week (esp. during the  workweek ,bec.  usually I ride a taxi when it's difficult to take the train or bus), I'll share this random conversation with manong taxi driver and from my observation, they seem to always  mention how ""life"" was easier  or ""better"" during the Marcos regime. Of course, I am living in the era where the reality is ""Filipinos hated the outcome of the Martial Law"" or should I say the ""Martial law"" so I couldn't really comment on what was being said that time  by the taxi driver. But you know, come to think of it, these taxi drivers must have gone through or have seen a lot to say such things. So since then, I've started to watch the late Marcos videos, speeches ( well, hindi ko naman napanood pa lahat ) .. and read few articles about him and I realized, there are good things that happened to our country during his time that wasn't written on our elementary or high school books ( or pwede din kasi sa school lang namin yun ) .. So since then, I try to keep an open mind,  everything that's written or reported these days are 100% inaccurate.  I so do wish, every concerned citizen will think the same and refrain from making snap judgements just because the tree bore a yellow or a red fruit.  Thank you po Ms. Toni for having a balance platform. God Bless you!

After watching the interviews, sana marami ang nakaobserve kung sino ang deserving manalo, and that is BBM! 

Share ko lang based on my experience, i'm a student at PUP and sobrang toxic sa university na yun. Kahit walang connection sa subject at lesson, ang tinuturo ng mga prof namin ay tungkol sa martial law at anti-marcos. Kapag pumalag ka sa mga sinabi nila na against kay marcos, bagsak ka kaya shut up na lang kami. Ang daming kabataan ang na-brain wash ng mga state universities at private kasi simula elementary palang sila ay tinuturuan na sila ng mga mali. Kaya tama yung sinabi ni BBM na lies become truth. Kaya kapag nanalo siya napresident sana mabago ang mga nakalagay sa libro at maling tinuturo na masama ang marcos. My parents and relatives mismo kinikwento samin kung gaano kaganda dito sa pilipinas noong panahon ni Marcos kasi naexperience nila at nasira lang dahil sa mga Aquino at mga dilawan.

I will always remember what our history teacher said, ""That history (books) are written by who's in power."" , and our family's elderlies words, Marcos era was way better than his successors.

Kahit sobrang daming paninira, never silang nagsabi ng masama laban sa mga kalaban nila. They stayed quiet and humble. Kahit sa interview na to. Samantalang yung kabila pag ininterview puro na lang paninira at pagbubuhat ng sarili nilang bangko. Dun palang makikita mo na kung anong klase silang tao. Usually yung mga taong humble, they are so calm kasi alam nila yung truth. And those people na naninira, they are so desperate to look like they are the innocent ones so they pretend to deceive people.

I still remember my father told me during pres Marcos about curfew... Basta sumunod ka sa batas hindi ka mapapasama.. May isang gabi naabutan sila ng curfew at nakainom sila.. Natural hinuli sila pero hindi sila pumalag, parang kinulong sila sa sasakyan Yun diko Alam tawag dun wala naman ginawa sa kanila kundi Para mawala Lang ang amats Nila at pinakawalan din. Dito sa lugar namin naalala ko panun Bata ako 1980's  nakasanayan na pagpumatak ng 7am sisirena ang plaza at lahat titigil maski mga sasakyan at mga naglalakad Para pa tugtugin ang Pambansang Awit..

their VISION for the Philippines is the most important thing that the other competitors doesn't have. And I think BBM have that all the time. Naghahanap kayo ng mga nagawa nya and natatawa ang mga anti-Marcos kasi di makapag bigay ng mga nagawa or contribution si BBM sa bansa, pero tingnan nyo nman naging experiences nya, sa murang edad pa lang..mulat na sya sa realidad na nangyayari sa palasyo at politika. Marami syang natutuhan hindi lang sa pag-aaral pati sa leadership na meron ang tatay nya. Hindi tulad ni Fuchsia pink na nabyuda lang nagka ambisyon nang maging pangulo. Mula noon hanggang ngayon walang pinagbago sa plataporma nya kundi puro tungkol sa pagiging ina ng bansa at pagtulong sa mahihirap, paano nman yung mga paraan mo para matulungan sila?? Anong mga icocontribute mo para makatulong sa kanila at mawala ang kahirapan sa bansa?? Napaka-Vague ng sinasabi nyang para lang makatulong sa mahihirap, sa tingin mo pagtulong lang ba sa mahihirap ang solusyon sa pag-unlad ng bansa??

Ang sarap ng pakiramdan na marinig na mayroong tao na nagtitiwala sa kakayahan natin,hindi yung pangako ng pangako lang. I am not a political person, but I would love to see Philippines on top,not only economically but also on their arts (bring back the love for OPM),skills,and nationhood. Nakakaproud dito sa abroad na magkikita mga pinoy,kahit pagod sa trabaho, makikita mo na dahil sa pamilya ,nagsisikap..nakikilala ang quality of work and talent..at nagtutulungan..sana ganto sa buong pinas,hindi yung kung kailan nasa abroad na,saka lang makikita ang kapatiran..

Election is coming and I‚Äôm trying search for more information about the people who‚Äôs going to run for president in 2022. I just don‚Äôt want to base on my own knowledge about someone. I still want to prove if it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been against Duterte kase naman hindi siya nakikinig at hindi pa agad binan yung travel especially nung time na mag spread na yung covid pero may mga gusto parin akong nagawa niya. Pati sa Marcoses ang dami kong narinig na masasama at pinaniwalaan ko yon hanggang sa yon nalang yung katotohanan na alam ko. These past few I‚Äôve been hearing about people and reading some comments bashing Toni kase dahil sa interview. Fan parin ako ni Toni kahit pa iba yung i-support niya sa sinu-support ko. Kaya ganun nalang tingin ko sa mga tao na nagagalit kase si Toni in favor kay Bong Bong Marcos and I think that‚Äôs fine because we have the freedom of speech and expression so we don‚Äôt have the right to tell someone on what to do. Everyone has the right to choose. Then I‚Äôm watching some foreigners especially korean who‚Äôs making fun of Filipinos dahil accent or educational system. Paano naman idi-discriminate eh kahit tayo pinagtatawanan natin sarili nating accent at baliw na baliw sa kpop. Pero naisip ko at some point may katotohanan naman sa sinasabi nila. About sa economy natin pati bilihin. Kaya naisip ko na panoorin tong interview ni Toni kay BBM. I have a lot of realizations. I‚Äôm thinking of voting him as a president in 2022 but I will still continue to search for more information pa.

This interview was neutral yet intellectual. I admire how BBM openly and professionally handles all the lies thrown against him, to his family, and especially to his father.
As a young adult, I grew up believing that Marcos made the lives of the Filipinos hard because of Martial Law, but upon listening to the testimonies of the ones who first handedly experienced the Marcos Regime and through research, my perception turned to 180¬∞.

Very pure and natural. I feel that he‚Äôs actually saying what‚Äôs in his heart. No flowering words, just the truth. Grabe out of nowhere, napaiyak nalang talaga ako kasi since my elementary days, puro kasamaan nya yung tinatanim ng turo ng libro sa isip ko.I remember my english/history teacher who was once against the lesson in the book that contains disproved issues and criticisms about FEM, she just told us, ‚ÄúACTUALLY NAABUTAN KONG NAGING PRESIDENTE SI FEM, AND ISA LANG MASASABI KO, HE WAS A GREAT LEADER, OUR ECONOMY WAS GREAT AND ALL THE FILIPINOS WERE DISCIPLINED.‚Äù And because of that, curiosity starts to grow in my head. But now, I realized that truths just came out naturally. Respect my comment guys. NO HATE NA SANA. JUST STOP THE HATE NALANG AND RESPECT EACH OTHERS OPINION. Basta ako, I should pick a leader who has the quality of being a ‚ÄúPATRIOTIC‚Äù not a SELF-CENTERED one.

Haters gonna hate, controversial na kung controversial, but for me, this interview is one of the most bona fide interviews ever done in social media..... This just purely showcase and features Mr. BongBong's life experiences, adversities and triumph, sorrows and joys,  how his uprbinging was, educational background, his lifestyle, his father's legacy, downfall and death, what he went through his teeneage years and adulthood and cope with those things, how his parents became phenomanal factors to hone and equip him as what he is the exact type of man right now.

Why am I rooting for BBM? Because my mom told me about my grandfather's story. He was a farmer, one of the farmers who benefited in PFM's Agrarian Reform Program. FM takes care of farmers. He had the IRRI, where  experts study how to produce quality rice and have an abundant harvest. Another thing that my mom told me, our brgy during her elementary days didn't have electricity, my grandfather, along with other men from our brgy wrote a letter to then First Lady Imelda Marcos, about the situation.  Imagine, it was a snail mail written to FL who at that time was Minister of Human Settlements, the letter was handwritten, they didn't have typewriter, yet after 3 weeks, people from Meralco came and a few days after, our barangay had electricity. This is my mom's personal experience. Would she invent this story? Of course not.  Nowadays, can we communicate with higher government officials that easily? I don't think so, but during FM's time, a letter sent by a group of farmers, was given importance and their problem was given a solution.

I studied in UPLB and strong anti Marcos talaga ang UP. One of the propaganda is to instill to the minds of the people that the Marcos regime was the worst. So our Professor made us interview people in nearby barangays in Laguna to interview them what life was like during Marcos, being so young and naive I was expecting negative comments. But I was wrong, like 1 out of 10 lang yung negative. Lahat puro good feedback during Marcos time. I can even remember interviewing this one security guard, I can sense his pride on his stories. Super proud daw mga tao noon to be called Filipinos because of how great our nation was. I remember presenting this assignment as a report in front of my class, in the middle of my presentation my professor cut me. He instead refocused the conversation on the usual - how terrible life was during Marcos time. I was so naive during that time and didn't even think about this. Pero now I realized, grabe pala talaga na twist ang facts. I'm from Bicol and I grew up hating the Marcos but now I know better.

To my surprise, they said a lot of good things about FEM and that they were a fan of  him. Imagine even foreigners know and praise FEM. Made me proud to be a Filipino. We cannot deny that he made the Philippines really great during his term. He was an actual leader. I hope BBM wins the presidency and continue his father's vision for our country.

Hi sayo Sir BBM. I wish manalo po kayo at maging presidente ng Pinas soon. Request ko lang po, if magpamartial law kayo like your father, dapat po buong Pilipinas na talaga. wag lang po dito samin sa mindanao. dapat po mas maghigpit kayo jan sa Luzon dahil mas deserve po nila yun dahil mas marami po reklamador jan at pawoke. pagod na po ako sa mga politician na nag uuto at sa mga pilipinong uto uto. Kahit naman po walang martial law yung gyera dito samin ay patuloy pa rin. kasi yung mga ibang politician jan wala naman pakialam sa amin taga mindanao. Kami itong namamatay dito sa mindanao dahil sa patuloy na pagpapadala ng mga sundalo kami pa tinatawag na terorista. Saan po ang hustisya don? Kaya sana po ikaw ang manalo at wag niyo lang pong kalimutan na kaming taga mindanao ay pilipino din at parte ng pilipinas.

That, ""tired of hearing lies which are already disproven"".  Mainstream media should play a big role in letting people know the truth, it is part of their social responsibility. Sadly, some, if not most, are being biased, used for the advantage of others or are purposely misinforming for clicks (clickbait), etc. Corrupting the minds of those people who are lazy for research or reading. Leaving the quote ""whoever controls the media, controls the mind"".

This interview has been trending on youtube for about a week now. It has been gaining more viewers and likes everyday. Indeed, Bongbong Marcos is a smart, genuine, true, straightforward, brilliant, and confident person. He has a wonderful charisma when he speaks. Indubitably, the Philippines needs another Marcos to lead this country. Let us all unite and support him to become the next President of our country. Finally, let us never allow another Yellowtard to rule our beloved country. #NeveragaintoDilawans

Obvious na sa lahat na siya ang nanalo 2016 palang. Pero kung Smartmatic nanaman ang gagamitin or mamanipulahin nananaman ay grabe naman talagang kaawa awa. Kaawa awa HINDI si  Bongbong Marcos kundi TAYONG mga Pilipino. Sabi ng lolo ko nung time ni Marcos proud Pinoys tayo. Itong interview makikita mo ang napaka talinong pakikipag usap. Saka hindi centered sa sarili at paninira sa iba kundi para sa pangkalahatan ang laging goals niya. Ewan ko nalang talaga sa mga nabubulagan padin until now na akala mo pinanganak nung panahon ng regime ni PFEM para manghusga.

I‚Äôm 51yrs old now. I still remember, on my 10th birthday, my father gave me a book as a present. The title of the book is‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúFerdinand E. Marcos: Itinadhana sa Kadakilaan‚Äù, by Anacleto I. Dizon. This book was very special to me‚Ä¶it bears the signature of the best president the Philippines ever had.
This is probably the best book i‚Äôve ever read about the life and adventures of the late president FEM. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still available on the market. If you can find one, buy it. I can guarantee, you‚Äôll gonna love it.

New generations were being blinded with the truth about Marcos leadership.  This time around, as an ordinary citizen, it will be a great honor for me to vote for Bong Bong to show my appreciation to his father.  I think it is not fair to say bad things on him.  He is a different person.  He is the only presidential candidate who doesn‚Äôt throw any shades to any candidates we have - for me this is one of the many traits of a good leadership.  If you guys wanted to associate marital law with Bong, well, I was born during martial law and all I could say it was the best Philippines we have.  1986 onwards, the country tumbles down economically and made the country from best to worst.  Philippine history needs major correction.  These are my personal thoughts.  Peace

He knows how his father works and it shows his admiration for his father.  It‚Äôs not making sense why people hated this video, but I can tell most loved it! More views as compared to Leni‚Äôs interview. Haha this has more sense  on our part, this interview is fair.

The best part of this interview is for BBM to look back into his training as a young child. Ganun dapat ang parents: they show what they do to their kids, and ask for an opinion from them like an adult! I mean, it will make kids learn to think critically for themselves when they grow up! Magandang pamantayan sa magulang ang isinasali ang mga anak sa iyong trabaho para may ideya sila. Ngapala napansin ko English ni sir: Laking UK nga... hehehe... Imbes na sabihin when I was sick, yung when you are ill... typical British. Hehe. Pero I think beyond his stay sa UK hindi iyon ang rason kung bakit very charming si BBM. Charming ang life nila as a family. I had the privilege of visiting the original residence of his dad in Batac: You would seriously doubt the veracity of plunder against the entire family because I just saw a simple home. Typical working class old wooden furnitures, mga crochet curtains.. then coming inside Marcos' room parang I smelled a hint of intelligence. This interview resonates that feeling about how Apo Lakay was as a man: typical single minded visionary. Mga war relics lang nakita ko noon. Hindi mahilig mag hoard si Apo Lakay ng mga luxury items. And if you watch his dad's interviews: he is not a palaaway, very forthright sumagot ng tanong (and sometimes remarkably witty.) May Alpha traits kumbaga. So BBM is lucky not to have a smart dad. But a dad, who is truthful, who has nothing to hide. By the way, I do not want as much to incite this but people do not know that a large tract of land from the Marcoses is a State University. Yes, Marcos was brave because he is not scared to educate people! Corrupt politicians sensationalize and fabricate truths and are terribly terribly horrified to lead a nation of people who think. Yan na. The truth is always self evident. It does not need to talk even. (Tamaan mga maingay na puro pukol ginagawa... ehehehe.)

My take on this Interview is that, Toni only showed in a subtle manner who Bongbong really is, as a Person. A good natured and meaningful interaction. If the Interviewer were the likes of Korina Sanchez, it would have geared to Politics and Marcos regime. Bongbong only has praises for his Dad because after all, he is his father's Son who look up to his Dad and witnessed how he worked hard on his position and he only elaborated the priviledged life they had, depicted as children of the President. And a Son as he is, Bongbong and his Dad are still two different people. Bongbong demonstrated no cynicism and no loathing for people who judged them for their Last Name. Because true to that, No Politician will never be criticized whether he do good or bad. He only uttered factual occurence. Never bad mouthed anyone. Having the priviledge to study and live in the West, he is even more Filipino than those Filipinos I know who also had the opportunity to study and live abroad. Bongbong Marcos is an eloquent, spontaneous, optimistic and an Intellectual man. In this Interview, we came to know who Bongbong Marcos really is. He is a man with substance, with conviction, dignified, has morals and Integrity.

Thats why Dilawan are so 
Mad. In this interview Bongbong show how Witty he is. Very calm, funny & most of all  he said was a  little side of his father  w/c the Pilipinos never & will never known if not for this interview. Very simple question of Toni  in a moderate way was answered by Bongbong . Flowing happiness from His heart how he  honored, respect, proud & love his father the way he was brought  up  & become  what he is now was coming from his heart. What is wrong of that dilawans. 30 years never stopped accusing Pres Marcos of LIES. You all know the truth that  your LIES is NOT  TRUE . The truth is Ninoy Aquino & Jomar Sison are partners in Crime they are the LEADERS of NPA, CDD & NDF. And Sison is living in another country in a very comfortable life & trying to manipulate how he can come back & make the Philippines a Communist country.  And this dilawans because they are greedy of Money they follow whatever Jomar Sison wants because of Money. MONEY & MORE money. You are all PATHETIC dilawans. Sorry for my English because Im not a college graduate.

Now watching this video interview with my 7 and 9 yo kids, and them asking me, ‚ÄúMom pls tell us more about Marcos.‚Äù is enough to make me teary eyed. Legacy lives. Truth will always come out.

My tears suddenly fall down as I heard the words, ""I had spent my whole life defending the Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now."" I see a heart of being a father to the nation. At naranasan ko ang pagiging tatay ni FEM sa mga bata sa Pilipinas dahil I was born in 1985 & the following years until FEM stepped down from Malaca√±ang naranasan namin na nakaluwag sa buhay dahil may support ang pamahalaan na mga 1st class na gatas, csm, bulgor at nutri bun. Papa ko farmer nakaranas ng kaginhawaan sa pagsasaka dahil sa Masagana program ng pamahalaan. Ang nangyaring rally noon kahit nga hanggang ngayon sa Manila lang naman naganap hindi nman ngrally buong Pilipinas. Yung mga nagrarally di naman supporter ng pamahalaan yan. Sa simula pa lang anti government na mga yan. Kahit sino presidente ilagay sa pwesto may magrarally pa rin kasi nakadikit na sa kanila ang masamang espiritu ng pagka rebellious na pag may hindi gusto sa pamamalakad ng pamahalaan gusto lagi idaan agad sa pag aalsa, sigawan at dahas at alam niyo po namamana at namamana yang masamang espiritu na yan sa sunod pang henerasyon kaya be careful po kayo dahil di po mabuting espiritu ang maipapamana niyo once mainvolve kayo sa isang pag aalsa. In the book of Romans chapter 13 says.. Submit to Government, ""Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God‚Äôs minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God‚Äôs minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience‚Äô sake.""

I literally cried watching this interview.
His father got sick because of the emotional pain. Imagine spending your life to serve people who later on want to oust you. Imagine having pure intention to help but people keep making lies about you. The worst part is when people keep hearing those lies, they start believing them. Not only that they believe  in them, they start spreading them; passing them to the next generations.

OMG! All BBM said were true. I was in the palace before the Marcoses left for Hawaii. During the time i was there, we asked he soldiers there,  why was it that Marcos allowed the rally in Edsa, the soldier, Marcos, doesnt want to hurt the filipino people. Im having goose pimple now as i reminisced it, The soldier told us, that in few seconds, Edsa would be cleared, had the President order to. Ilang minuto lng daw ubos ang tao sa EDSA sa isang utos lng ni Marcos, pero di pumayag  si Mracos. Yan and di alam ng tao at yan ang ayaw nila paniwalaan, hatred ang nangibabaw sa tao, ultimo mga taong di naabutan ang Martial Law, galit! Grabe! Para sa akin, si Marcos pa rin ang pinaka magaling na Philippine President. Mga nasa ilalim nya ang namantala sa position and thats inevitable, Di  alam ni Marcos lahat ng galaw ng mga nasa ilalim nya, Sana, matuto ang tao na maging bukas abg isipan, Hindi puro galit. Mabuhay ka BBM! God bless your political career. I believe you very much, and definitely will support you. MABUHAY ka po!

You touch the most sensitive feeling of the Filipinos with that simple question. Good job Madam Tony. Keep up the good work.

Im a millenial, buong akala ko and maybe they instill it in our young minds in textbooks elementary and high school that marcoses are bad guys, then when i go to college in state university we have minor subject in political science and the first topic is philippine history,our professor really explain the real history with an open mind without reading textbook or a reference, nagkwekwento lang talaga sya, and im so amazed. Na may mga bahagi ng kasaysayan na noon ko lang narinig. that's the time na nagkaroon ako ng open mind to listen, research and study what really happens in our history.We support late Sen.

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this interview. Made me cry when He is remembering his dying father, how he looked at before passing away. Honestly that moment was both pain and hapiness, undescribable feeling. I could relate as i have lost my brother last month, how pain will never ever go away but you‚Äôll live with it. This interview focused more about His life,a son, a husband, a father and a little bit of how he is as a politician being a Marcos. Neither they stole a money from the people, we have no right to judge as we aren‚Äôt God who is rightful.

The Marcos siblings have class, dignity, and calmness, and without any sign of hate despite all the things that happen to them. Instead, they show admirable characters we rarely see in famous politicians today. He is a true person with good and a humble heart.

I watched his some interviews and his vlogs. I'd noticed that he never say bad words to their opponents. Unlike the other politicians they'll slur the reputation of their opponents so that they will be good to the people.  He has words of wisdom. He's very cool, humble ang intelligent person. This man has full of visions can raise Phils. and  be a better nation again~ God bless Philippines! Mabuhay~

This is what Filipinos need to realize.  During that Edsa Revolution, they had the advantage militarily but they chose not to fight. And it is not written on History Books, thats why I support History Revisionism to hear the other side of the story. To make it fair for the Marcos. Let's hear them people.

Not only him but all of us shouldn't be blamed for the things that we didn't do. Attack him for the things that he really did on his own.

Sa lahat ng interview mo Ms Toni dito ko naiyak kasi naramdaman ko at nakita ko, base sa mga nakikita ko ngayong panahon na ito.  During Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Marcos time after World war 2 sila ang nag restore at build ng Kanilang bansa in a similar way. They are both strict in a sense that can govern their nation. But for me Base on what i search, a long time of searching and keep asking for the truth bakit ang hirap maging Filipino, ang baba ng tingin sa Filipino this period of time. I felt relieve, now i have the answer. Thanks, hope for the best Philippines

i dont really get the point why people are coming at toni for doing this interview. a lot of us grew up with just one story about the martial law, because the marcoses almost really never had their chances to talk about it before, nor they were even asked to do so. but to see toni use her platform to see both sides of the story just gives me chills and all. it's very rare to see people like her giving chances to people who were objectified by the majority to speak up and tell stories. bbm even said from the beginning, ""thank you for taking the trouble"" because he knew that people are gonna take this interview negatively, just like how we've always known and understood their family and his father's regime. this interview clearly has no intention of questioning the history, because this interview is about a son telling stories of him and his father.

Ang tanging mararamdaman mo lng eh ung pagmamahal nila sa ating mga pilipino. Unlike sa mga dilawan na laging may patama at panira sa knila or sa ibang tao. Totoo ngang hindi natatabunan pera at katanyagan ang tunay na meaning class , may karunungan at may pagmamalasakit na tao.

Sobrang ganda ng sinasabi ni BBM about his father. Makikita mo talaga na sobrang proud siya sa daddy niya. Go BBM for president 2022. I salute you sir specially to your father. I remember when my lola said. Ferdinand marcos is the best president and he really good person he doing a good job.
"Came back to this because now he is the new President of our country. To be honest, I was undecided a few months back but I happened to watch this interview. I was amazed by his sincerity and humility. God bless you, Mr. President. God bless our country. "
"I don't regret voting him. Been a silent supporter for a long time and was questioning myself if it is right to stay quiet even if people are throwing, calling them all the bad names in the world. But when he says that ""I have advantage because I know the Truth"" , it made me realize that I did the right thing. Staying quiet and doing nothing doesn't mean your weak, it's just that you know better and you're just doing the right thing than being violent towards your countrymen. God Bless the Philippines and all the Filipinos."
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down we're not shooting anyone""
-Ferdinand Marcos. 
Please sabihin niyo sakin, na hindi siya karapat dapat maihimlay sa libingan ng mga bayani 
Been a silent Marcos supporter for such a very long time and I definitely don't regret my vote for him. Set aside all the critics, "
"I feel BBM's honesty for his public service and being proud of Filipinos. May God guide you on how to really revive our nation from the nightmare of poverty, corruption, and illiteracy."
"I'm a Marcos hater then. Since my early childhood I was exposed hearing my father (RIP)and his friends talking about how bad Marcos then. Mga 9 yrs pa lang ako noon and I was not aware then that my father was a member/symphatizer of Hukbalahap syempre that time leftist sila. Nakalakihan ko na ang hatred against Marcoses. I was working in abroad when the hstoric and fateful day, EDSA People's Power erupted. I cried tears of joy seeing those people marching and staying in the streets and more so when Marcoses left the palace. I went home to Philippines and with great hope I applied for work in Malacanan and was hired in RTVM (Presidential Broadcast Staff) Close-on kami ni Tita Cory noon at immuned kami sa mahigpit ng security ng PSG tuwang-tuwa ako noon kasi nakakalapit kami shoulder to shoulder with the president. Then, as ime passed working with RTVM I realized what they were doin. We were told and assigned to do black propagandas against Marcos who at that time matagal ng patay and the family was no longer in power. Naisip ko ano ang saysay ng gingawa namn matagal ng patay si Apo Lakay binubugbog pa namin! I resigned, that was the time I changed my heart. Naisip ko peaceful naman noon kahit may martial law at naisip ko rin na kung di ka naman gumagawa ng masama e bakit ka i-presecute ng gobyerno. We, our family voted for BBM! Happy to see them back. Malacanang Redemption!"
Ito lang talaga yung politician na wala kang narinig na paninira sa iba napaka humble. kaya sa 2022 saiyo ang boto namin. #BBM2022
"Just bump into this video right now. Now he is the President of the Philippines. I just realized, my vote was not put to waste. It was a good decision that I voted for him. He is a man of wisdom. "
Wala akong ma afford na salita kundi maraming salamat sa ama mo at sayu. Mananaig parin ang katotohanan at ngayun yun mangyayari. Thank You Miss Toni for allowing us to know more about Marcos. Godblessyou Kaya gusto kong manuod nang Interviews mo kasi you inspire me at good example ka sa amin at lalong lalo na sakin. GodblessusallÔ∏è
"When he said ""I have spent my whole life defending Pilipinos I cannot hurt them now""(Put your guns down and we're not shooting anyone)This strikes to the heart talaga masasabi ko talaga literal na ang hirap mahalin ang mga Pilipino  binigay na lahat-lahat kulang pa din ikaw pa masama"
You can literally see and feel how genuine and honest he is..
"I will never get tired watching this interview.. thank you Ms Toni for standing up for him Ô∏è Congratulations, PBBM!!! I am one of the 31M and words are not enough to express how grateful and thankful I am to GOD for answering my prayer! May God's blessings come to you a thousand fold and may God guide you and VPIS on this path Ô∏è Sama sama tayong babangon muli! üáµüá≠"
"I felt the sincerity. Talking out of reality. Hindi scripted, hindi plastic. #BBM the next president of the üáµüá≠.. May God guide & bless you po."
I never regretted that I used my first official vote for President Bong Bong Marcos.
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I can't hurt them now."" Words from a great man so much maligned and humiliated by his own countrymen."
Proud filipino and a part of 31 million history of marcoses! Mabuhay ang pilipino! Mabuhay ang pilipinas!

"MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FORMER MAYOR OF TAYTAY, PALAWAN AND I REMEMBER HIM LITERALLY PAINTING A ""VOTE MARCOS"" ON A FLATTED TIN CAN... DI PA USO ANG POSTER NOON... WHEN THE MARCOSES FLED TO HAWAII MY MAMA AND AUNTIES WERE CRYING... MARCOS IS THE BEST... AND LET US ALL HOLD HANDS TOGETHER AND VOTE FOR BONGBONG MARCOS..."
"Everytime i watch President BBM's video nakaka-goosebumps and nakakaiyak. Even nung nanalo sya, i cried. I cried not because i am sad but because i am happy. He deserve it. And now, watching this video made me cry even more. How sincere he is. Minanipula talaga ang history sa schools hahaha. Panahon na ng pagbabago."
Gandang ganda parin ako sa interview na to! The best! Hindi mag sasawa kahit paulit2 ko pang panuurin. Andami kong natutunan. Wala akong natutunan na hate or hatred. Tunay ngang lumaki sa mabuting pamilya. Dama ko yung katutuhanan. Very natural din sumagot si President Bong Bong. Congratulations President Bong Bong Marcos Jr! I'm so happy and proud na isa ako sa 31 million!Ô∏èÔ∏è
Pano nya ikwento lahat simula ng bata sya kitang kita kung gaanong naging mabuting tatay si pangulong Ferdinand Marcos. Ô∏èÔ∏è
"Totoo talaga yung sinabi ni BBM, na nawala nating mga Pilipino ang pagiging proud sa nationality natin. Satingin ko dahil yan sa mga napapanood natin mula nung bata tayo. Karamihan ng balita na maririnig patungkol sa ating bansa ma pa radyo man o TV ay masama. Onti onti tayong namuhi sa ating pinagmulan. Kaya hindi natin masabi sa buong mundo na ako ay proud Pilipino. Sana nga maibalik natin ito upang maging isang totoong nasyon ulit tayo."
"Being a silent supporter is hard specially if almost all of you're friends is against him, but He really keeps on proving me that voting and supporting him is not a mistake Congratulations APO BMM."
"This man is not just intellectual, you just know his heart to help our country. Thanks Toni for doing this interview. Not biased, not noisy and not judging. #BBMismyPresident"
It all started in here..Toni was truly AMAZING! She‚Äôs a very strong and brave woman..she stood by him while others was scared to be cancelled..
It's incredibly great that I spend my 28 minutes watching this interview. He has a lot to tell us. He shows sincerity to serve the public. I love how he speak every words. There is a genuine feeling there. He is the best of all presidential candidates. I believe in him. #BBM #MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS 
Bumalik ako dito pagkatapos ko manuond ng Proclamation ni PBBM AYYYSS GRABE THANKYOUUUU TONI G.. DITO TALAGA NAG UMPISA MAMULAT ANG MGA TAO Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
This interview has started it all... it ignited the hearts of the Filipinos..
"Ngayon ko lang pinanood. Di ko pa rin talaga kaya na hindi umiyak knowing how they were treated. But still chose to love the country. I only read books about them, and heard stories from my parents and grandparents. Nakakaiyak talaga. "
"This is my 8th times watching this, im still teary eyes, the more i repeat watching the more i admire BBM, the most deserving presidential candidate for the philippines, like his father, thank you toni,very inspiring interview, im sure this is not my last time watching this kung pwede lng mag like uli, i lilike ko pa uli"
"It all started here. As an Ilocana, im so proud of you PBBM. You deserve to be our President. I am one of the 31m who stood and fought for you through social media. Naabutan ko pa ang panahon ng dad mo and i can say life before was so so much better. Everything was cheap, from electric bills down to basic needs. My parents are govt employees but i can say na hindi sila hirap noon and all praise sila sa magandang pamamalakad noon. I cannot √®ven spend my allowance during my elem years kasi libre na sa school ang merienda ng trigo, nutri bun busog ka na nun. At pag uwian may take home pa na klim na gatas at yellow corn powder na super sarap.."
"Even here at work, (which is a hospital in Bay Area, CA) when I say I‚Äôm Filipino they always tell me a story about Marcos. About how good he was when it was his time, (and I‚Äôm talking about patients  of mine are mostly elderly that knew our Philippine history) Alam nila the good things that happened when it was his regimen, I‚Äôm happy that Sir Bongbong won! Now I‚Äôm excited to visit our country again! Mabuhay Pilipinas!"
"Wow 15m views na, kulay pink pa suot,  congrats BBM, Sara! üáµüá≠"
"Mr. President, I know what they did to your father was unforgivable, but I know that you're bigger than them. From the bottom of my heart; I wish you all the luck, may God give you guidance in leading the country. Mabuhay po kayo at ang bansang Pilipinas! "
"I understand the luxury play of Marcos Sr. -He's trying to represent the Philippines to other countries that filipinos are not small and he stood up with Elegancy, Alpha Male. That they should come visit, do business and prosper together with the Philippines as the center. That was destroyed when small people with lack of vision provoked and misunderstood his play. We hoped to be a great Country again and many of us are here to support our new great president. May you be blessed with more wisdom as we welcome your family back and lead our Country."
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, then you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Äù - Bongbong Marcos 

I love that line‚Ä¶ hahahaha ayos! Kaya BBM for president Ô∏è"
"Keep being healthy PBBM and stay safe 'coz we, Filipinos are rooting for you. I am one of the Filipinos who believed, believes and will continuously believe in your capacity to become our leader. You have that dedication to serve the Philippines. Continue your father's legacy of making the Philippines a better nation. God bless you po. üáµüá≠ "
"I do not know what really happened that time, but when I watch this I really feel that your Father did justify the true meaning of Leadership. We will support you all the way."
"From the start to end of this video, I get to know about him. He is so direct and has a vision to his countrymen. He is also a humble man. What strikes me the most is when he said ‚ÄúTo continue sense of nationhood. We were united as one. We‚Äôre all working in the same direction And we‚Äôve lost that a little bit‚Ä¶ I would like to restore that.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs keep the unity as one nation and someday the Philippines will be great and successful again Ô∏è."
Watching this again after his first interview as a President with Toni Talks...amazing...I'm proud to vote for him Ô∏è
I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIM! FULL OF WISDOM AND COMPASSION! PERFECT TO BE A PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY OF COMPASSIONATE AND HARD WORKING HUMAN! PROUDER THAN BEFORE TO BE FILIPINO from Japan üáØüáµ!
No one else can bring back the Philippines to be a Great Nation again but BBM - The Son of the Best President that the Philippines has Ever had.
"He and his family  are just too good to be true..the mere fact that he and his family been able to handle such cruelty for such a long time,they remained humble and patient.if i where on their shoe i might be already inside a casket now. My vote for this man didn't went wasted and  is something that i did was right. I wish you and your family good health. May God bless you more for having a big heart not just for the few but for the entire Filipinos sir!! My full support will alwys be with your good governance.Ô∏è"
The last part of this interview gives me a lot of realizations.. being real being responsible and the idea of being true and resilient.. Filipinos already decipher all the truths and that is the most important ..
After 9 months binalikan ko talaga yung interview nato.. Tiningnan ko lang sino may pinaka mlakaing views sa toni talks.. Ito lang talaga yung unbeatable.. Dami pading interested sa videos na ito.. Thank you Toni G. Panalo tayo.
"Naiyak ako dito dios ko!  So true President Marcos Sr talaga and truly na nagmahal sa Pinas.  Im glad that BBM won, he will make PInas a better country again."
I came back after the election to watch again! I am very proud to be a Filipino for the second time after PRRD. Alam ko na may mga surprises ang mga Marcos sa mga Filipinong namumuhay sa Pinas.From Germany with LOVE to all BBM and Sara Duterte Supporter.Hindi tayo nabigo at hinding hindi tayo bibiguin ni BBM dahil nakikita natin sa kanyang puso.God Bless ou UNITY FOR A PROGRESIVE PHILIPPINES.
"Toni is awesome at it! Her listening skills is right on. She rephrase, she follow -up on what he says...and she ask the question based on what he just said then builds the story from that..."
"I'm still wide awake watching Toni Talks. It‚Äôs already 3:16am in California. I‚Äôm so sleepy and tired, but I can‚Äôt stop watching all her videos. I‚Äôve watched 10 videos already. Every video is so interesting and inspiring it made me cry a few times lol. Toni is truly very talented. She's gifted with great communication skills. "
"The way Pres Bongbong Marcos describe what filipinos are, makes me really proud to be a Filipino. We're amazing!"
Bumalik dito dahil nanalo na ang binoto ng nakakarami. Mabuhay ang mga Filipino. Mabuhay tayong lahat.
Credits to his mother and father‚Ä¶. He was raised as a good human being with soul; spirit and love for his country and people.
"I spend my life protecting my fellow pilipino I cannot hurt them now.
- Ferdinand Marcos Sr

Luckily my last is Marcos and I'm proud of it."
"I love how he speaks about Filipinos in high regards. Parang nahiya ako to myself because i only see our negative traits. And that's usually what i also hear from other filipinos too. Bongbong is right, we need to reignite that nationhood we once had."
"I only watched this for the 1st time and I see now what I refused to see before. BBM has so much to be admired for. I see his brilliance, his sincerity, humility & more. 
I know that our country & our people will be in good hands under his Presidency.
It's a very beautiful interview. "
"I would never get tired with this video. I remember someone, a graduate of UP who had a change of heart towards BBM after watching this. Very human. Very real. All the lies thrown at him will not matter, your truth is our truth. We love you President BBM. God bless you Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"""Whatever your color is, you are still a Filipino."" I just watched it recently, and I must say that Congrats Mr. President, I hope you can really tell the true story amidst the lies because the truth will always prevail"
"One of the reasons of why i supported BBM-Sara last elections is their sincere and genuine love for the philippines.. yon lang naman ang gusto namin, mahalin natin ang pilipinas para sama sama tayong babangon..

sawa na kami sa away pulitika na sa huli, kakahanap ng masisisi e nalilimutan na ang pag unlad ng bansa.. this is our primary goal, paunlarin ang bansa at ipagmalaki ang pagka-Pilipino.. üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠"
"11:00
I watched this one more time. Coz I know in my heart you'll be our PBBM. Your Dad is so proud of you Ô∏è"
ito na yata ang pinaka magandang interview ni BBM simpleng simple lang para lang siyang nakikipag kwentuhan relax na relax. good job din kay ate toni husay nya talaga pagdating sa hosting. napa subscribe tuloy ako dahil dito. congrats sa inyong dalawa.
"We love BBM so much
Congrats our feuture presedent,,
bangon pilipinas,,"
"I've watched this interview a hundred of times already, and it really didn't bored me at all. This is the kind of interview where you can pass on to the new generations and so on... "
When Marcoses talk .. We clearly see the sincerity of a Great Leader
May God bless you. I admire how you define Filipino people. I pray for healing and united Philippines once again. Ô∏èüáµüá≠
This is my second time to watch this and still teary eyes. I'm so proud of the late FEM
"It's my 4th time watching this. I hope  kids nowadays would really know Pres Marcos and what he did for the  our country. He is not perfect but among the Pres we had so far he is the best for me. I hope the Philippines can still be the tiger of Asia again, God willing."
Hindi nakakasawang panoorin ang interview na ito  I kept on watching many times now.
We love you PBMM. Kaming 31M will always support  and pray for you. Thank you Miss Toni binalikan ko talaga tong interview na ito.  Godbless po. 
Dito sa interview na ito nag umpisa kung bakit dumami ang mga taong nag bago ang pananaw tungkol sa mga Marcos Ô∏è
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job. I have spent my whole life defending Filipino people, I cannot hurt them now. Put your gun down, we‚Äôre not shooting people.‚Äù True leader indeed. As for Bong Bong Marcos, we‚Äôre rooting on you to make Philippines great again. That was the ‚Äúlast look‚Äù from your father."
Binalikan ko to after nanalo cya. Ang sarap sa pakiramdam! Ô∏èüá®üá¶üáµüá≠
"Well done Ms. Toni for giving Mr. Bongbong Marcos, an opportunity to speak out the brief history of his family and to our country as well, I‚Äôm praying that God will place a decent politician to our country according to his will! Ô∏è"
"""the best thing that you can do is to help other people, to help as many other people as you can. what could be better than that?"" those are very touching words especially now that you are our president. you are now in a very powerful position to help as many filipinos as you can with your political authority. may you be able to help even those powerless filipinos who are usually neglected or overlooked by our government agencies."
"Came back to this after watching the exclusive interview with PBBM. Ang bilis one year na agad.

#HappyBirthdayPBBM"
"Congratulations Bongbong Marcos, President of the Philippines."
"Nakakaiyak, this video was taken last year, and when Ms Toni asked, ""where do you see yourself next year?"" and pops said still in public service kasi it's never finished, and here we are today year 2022 - President ka na po namin  Grabe Yung way ni Lord."
At dito nagsimula ang lahat..üáµüá≠
"now I know why the opposition would hate this interview, is because it humanized the senior Marcos, and the junior Marcos as a real, genuine person.
this interview was beyond excellent..the answers were absolutely perfect, concise and delivered in a very Marcosian way"
God raises the humble in heart‚Ä¶God is our great defender! God bless your presidency PBBM!
"We are looking forward for a better Philippines,CONGRATULATIONS SIR MR.PRESIDENT BONGBONG MARCOS.MAY THE GOD BLESS U AND YOUR FAMILY ESPECIALLY MADAM IMELDA MARCOS'' Now i can say ang SARAP MAGING PILIPINOüáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠"
"""Always work hard, hardwork is always rewarded"".."
"Looking back  and watching this again after a year the presidency is really BBMs destiny , its what God wanted if not prayers granted , from all of us who voted and prayed and believe in the Marcoses, Thank you Toni , this interview was the turning point of his journey, Thank God  for you and Direct Paul Ô∏è"
"Dito ako nagsimula na naging pro marcos ,dati din ako anti marcos. 1 year na pla ako pro marcos"

Sabi nila noon kaya madami daw views and likes ito dahil sa mga trolls pero pinakita nating 31M Filipino voters na mga totoong tao tayo na sumusuporta kay BBM.
"""If you're making our enemies angry, you're doing a good job."" How true! The evil will always try to paint you as the evil one, they project who they are on their enemies. God bless the Philippines!!! God bless the Filipinos and the new administration of President BBM and VP Duterte.  "
"I didn't vote this last election. I was  born 3 years after the Martial Law. I really don't care about Politics since I've experienced no significant changes during the past administration (except for Duterte). Heard a lot of stories about your family- good and bad. 
Please make our country the Pearl of Asia again. Where no one will ever look down on us again like what your father did. Protect the OFW, children and all the Filipino people."
"Very respectful conversation! Professional journalists, especially rappler ones should watch this interview and learn from Toni. No personal ‚Äòattack‚Äô in any form. No signs of prejudice in her manner of asking questions. Great job!!"

And I believe in you! #BBMismypresidentfor2022"
"I never get tired watching and hearing this interview. I kept watching this over and over again. Eversince in my childhood, I have been always on the truth side about Marcos'. My father is one of the living witnesses about them. And, one among those who had given help by the late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Administration.  We will help PBBM!

This is the 3rd time I'm watching this interview of Toni on Sen. Bongbong and its still amaze me how this man handle all the criticism and hates against his family. I couldn't agree more to this man to become the next president of the Philippines because of his intelligence and also experiences from his father (former President FEM) great governing in the Philippines.
"Ngayon ko lng talaga ‚Äòto na dare e watch. I don‚Äôt know why but from the moment BBM show his interest for VP/ Pres. I always feel goosebumps and it makes me sad pagngwwatch ako ng news/videos about him/them. 

I can‚Äôt imagine the life they live during these years emotionaly. "

Dito talaga nag start e. Dito ako namulat sa interview na to na BBM is a really nice person
This was the interview that changed my political perspective.
"Nung nanalo si duterte as president I‚Äôm praying na sana gabayan sya ng panginoon habang nasa posisyon, ngayon I‚Äôm praying again god please gabayan nyo po si bbm wag nyo pong pababayaan hanggang matapos ang kanyang pag lilingkod sa bansa. "

"Rewatched it today, one week after the May 2022 elections. and BBM is now our president! when i watched this the 1st time last year, it changed my mind about the Marcoses and started to research. now i'm happy and thankful that BBM won by a landslide victory!  PFEM's ""last look"" brought tears...again. God bless you Mr. President!"
Its good to hear his real life stories. I always like how he talks. My mom also said his father was an intelligent President. When are we going to have Sir Bong as our President? Thank you Toni Talks for interviewing him.
"I watched this several times‚Äî- and  each time I cried‚Ä¶.. I miss this family‚Ä¶.. long live BBM!,,    Love your family!,,"
Wow what a historical and humane interview salamat Toni and to your great team! Ô∏è I THANKED GOD that he won at sana mabayaran din niya taxes niya Ô∏è
Sinong bumalik dito after WINNING? hehe
"THIS STARTED IT ALL!!!! AND NOW HE IS OUR PRESIDENT!!! THANK YOU, TONI G!!! Ô∏è"
"Kasama mo kami BBM ,31 million na naniniwala sayo at may tiwala sayo.Mabuhay ang Pilipinas dahil ikaw ang niloob manalo at magpapatuloy ng nasimulan ng Pangulo Dueterte.üáµüá≠"
Toni thanx for this wonderful interview. Your did a great job. Eto yng gusto nmin pina pakita sa mga tao na wala kang kinikilingan na panig. God bless toni Ô∏è
"Mr. President BBM I hope I will meet you in person one day. After spending my 30 years of my life as nurse in America you made me feel proud of my Filipino heritage. "" The Best Nurses in the world are made in the Philippines!"""
"Toni questions very educated, and bongbong answer came from his heart, no lies. It‚Äôs not all about his want but to the favor of his nation. Marcos really love the Philippines üáµüá≠."
Binalikan ko tong panuorin ngayon at President ka na po Pops Bongbong Marcos.  Congratulations po   .  Thank you for this Ms. Toni.
When it comes to family our heart will melt down no matter what
This interview of PBBM reminds me the pain of losing a father. Yung lumaki kang may mapagmahal at mabuting Papa then one day makikita mo syang binawian ng buhay sa harap mo mismo.
A man who needs no introduction yet whose interview views exceed that of the number of subscribers Tonitalks has. And its growing still.
"Ang ganda naman, totoong totoong magsalita, straight talaga..salamat Mr. BBM, sana giginhawa na ang Pilipinas..Happy Birthday po"
"Literally, BBM will make Philippines great once again!"
"Time flies so fast, the man speaking in this video is now the 17th President of the Republic of the Philippines."
"it's 15M views already...
I won't be surprise if it will reach 31M  or more before July 1, 2022
Thank you Ms Toni Gonzaga for this interview."
Bumalik ulit ako dito to say Congrats po Our President
"What I love most in this interview is that when Sir Bongbong talks about the best traits of the Filipinos, having faith and cheering up all Filipinos. He still believes that we Filipinos can make a difference, that we Filipinos can make it... to be reunited and to be as one again. Very nice interview Ms Toni G. Congrats! To Sir Bongbong keep safe and Mabuhay ka!"
Omg ! how many times I‚Äôve watched it and it‚Äôs always made me cry  I love the Marcos .
You are the way to heal every hurts and bad memories ..you are send by your father to heal our country... thanks BBM..
We will always support your family and defend the truth behind the deceit and lies that has been embedded in a revised history of the Philippines.
"i finished this interview , so very proud to our next president i was amzed his sincerity and humility. talagang natural at ramdam ko mahal nya tayong mga pilipino at mahal nya ang bansang pilipinas.good job miss tony, God bless to our new president"
"‚ÄúPray for kings and others in power, so we may live quiet and peaceful lives as we worship and honor God.‚Äù #1Timothy2v2 cev  God bless you President Bongbong Marcos and God bless the Philippines "
"When he said ""If my father said just study hard you're okay with him."" reminds me off ""If you're a law abiding citizen you're okay with him."""
"rewatching after president pops acknowledged toni as a brave and ""badass"" woman who started their whole campaign. I am crying œÄœÄ"
"I remember when we were kids, we wear red clothes and learn the peace sign as showed being supporters of Marcos. We grew up with our Grandparents saying Marcos is best leader of Philippines and the life of Filipinos then is way better and Dollar exchange is not high compared now. It's about time to have a good leader again."
"Grabe kahapon Lang nakapanood ng mga vlog ni BBM and their clips about later Ferdinand Marcos, and yes his voice is like his father! I have no idea about then kasi baby pa ako nun, but now looking back it‚Äôs amazing !"
"I (an OFW based in UK) was approached by an old woman and asked: ""Are you a Filipino?"" - Yes (of course, diba). She said ""You know, I lived in the Philippines for 4 years back when Marcos was the president. And now, Marcos is back again."" You can feel the warmth and joy from her words."
I must say Thank you so much  Ms. Toni nang dahil sainyo namulat ako at naging bahagi ng 31M+ Filipino na nagloklok kay Pangulong Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos.
I want my children and my Grandchildren now to experience Marcoses Leadership and How they lead and make the people Restore Themselves and TO BE GREAT NATION AGAIN Ô∏è
"Mabuhay ka Apo BBM!!!  We will never forget your father's kindness and generosity to us military families.  Your father was good to soldiers and my late father remained loyal to your father until the day he died.  Kasi po, kung hindi dahil sa mga benepisyong binigay ng tatay nyo ay matagal na po kaming namatay sa gutom.  Totoo po iyan. God bless you and I wish you success as the new president of the Philippines."
"We are so grateful having you back after so many decades. Now that you have redeemed your name I wish that you will be guided and protected 24/7, may you be surrounded with good people and God curse those who will try with their power to put you and your family down again. We all love you and your family BBM. Let 's move on people, be like this man. Congrats sa ating lahat na sumusporta kay BBM."
"""hindi ko maintindihan kung bakit galit sila sa daddy ko""
Sounds so heartbreaking to me :(("
"Pinanood ko to ngayong siya na yung magiging Presidente ng Pilipinas. Naiyak ako para sa kanya.  Imagine, He spend his life dealing with all the hates, lies, and bashers... I'm proud to say that I am one of the 31million+ who voted him  Godbless on your presidency sir BBM. Marami kaming mulat na sa katotohanan na nagmamahal sayo, majority of the Filipinos love and supports you po. Sobrang saya ko na magiging kayo na po ang Presidente nang sa ganon po ay maitama mo yung mga dapat itama at mabago mo po yung tingin ng ibang tao po sayo. And I know how genuine you are, na tunay yung malasakit mo sa bansa natin kitang kita naman.. We love you po. God Bless "
"I just want you to know that if you have turned away from the Lord, turn back to him. Don't let the devil in your body win. If you believe you will never be forgiven because you have committed many sins, you are mistaken. God is good and willing to forgive us as long as we confess all of our sins.  "
"Proud ilocano Ô∏è.May God bless kung sino man papalain manalo sa pagka pangulo .
Just love no hate 

#BBMismyPRESIDENT "
"Marcos is a hero! Because of his intelligence and great leadership maraming nainggit kaya maraming gusto syang pabagsakin.
Envy is a deadly sin. The way he talk and answers all questions, you will know it is true, na tinago ng mainstream media. God bless your family sir.
Thank you Toni for standing the truth kahit alam mo na aalisin ka sa network nyo because you support Marcos, yun yung tunay napaninindigan sa katotohanan."
"I was not born in time of Marcos Sr. presidency, but I appreciate everything good he did for the Philippines."
He was forgiven already and I know he has a sincere and humble heart for all.üáµüá≠
I got teary-eyed going to the last part of the interview I can see how real he is and his father was Knowing how other people criticized him (the Marcoses rather) I CAN REALLY SAY THAT THEY WERE WRONG BY THROWING THEM DIFFERENT WORDS.. I'm so happy that I voted him God bless you Mr. President and all of us Filipinos
Went to watch this again. I never regret voting for you! You'll do a good job as our President together with Inday Sara. Mahalin natin ang Pilipinas! Ô∏è
"In my opinion, I think Ms.Toni‚Äôs channel theme is to inspire people through featured life stories nothing political. I hope everyone will respect this interview."
"As a first-time voter who voted last May 9, 2022, as well as someone who knows the truth about the Marcoses, it made me cry kasi the young people who's as old as me (or even younger than me) are part of the haters of his family kasi they believed in the repeated lies, which became the truth today. I have always saluted the perseverance of Pres. Marcos Sr., especially during the time when the opposition yearned for his step-down. How I wish the young people knew the truth about who the Marcoses really are, and not how they are depicted in history books, social media, and the news. Until now, I'm still so proud that I voted for Bongbong Marcos as the next president of the Republic of the Philippines. Marcos Forever!"
This is the first time I've watched this and I can proudly say that I voted the right president. They can say all the things they want to say against him or his father but It's not going to change the way I see a person. I can see that he has a goal to help the Philippines and the Filipino people. God bless BBM and the Philippines.
"Right now, BBM is officially proclaimed as the 17th president of the Philippines! Mabuhay ka, Ginoong Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr.... "
"Watched this 2 times.

I'm backnto this interview after BBM won.And it still makes me cry talking about FEM and his words and how he was a leader,a husband and a Father."
"great to have this, learning the true Marcos. Hoping from you BBM, you will continue the vision of your father  - ""Maging great country again"""
"I personally like how he speaks. He seems like a person na kapupulutan ng aral. Wise. Iba kasi eh. There's something about his aura showing that he's truly intelligent. Tung tipong hindi pilit. Hindi pinangangalandakan. Natural. Walang bahid ng kaplastikan. Panahon na para mas lalaong yumabong ang mahal nating bansa. He is clear about what he wants for the country. He is not busy trying to pin down other ""enemy"" candidates unlike what others are doing. He is focused on his vision. I can imagine, he might be strict but it will be for the best. We all have this chance to choose this incredible man and change the course of our nation. I've always been embarassed when friends from other country asks me where I'm from. I never wanted to say I was Filipino. I gained back the sense of pride when PD30 sat on the position. Now I'm more than ready to raise our flag again. I am excited for the day I can fully and proudly say I am Filipino."
"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre tough not in that arrogant or aggressive way,we‚Äôre tough in a very gentle Asian way.The most remarkable quality that Filipinos have‚Äù.Very well said Pres.BBMCongratulationsmore power and GOD blessÔ∏è"
"Mas lumakas lalo paninindigan ko na iboto si BBM, because he never cares for bashers, critics. He knew it was part of politics and that's makes me proud of him Ô∏èÔ∏è Mabuhay ka Mr. President, bring back Philippines to the top! We will rise again!!! Ô∏èÔ∏è (BEST INTERVIEW I've ever watched, Mabuhay ka Toni, Direk Paul and BBM)
#MarcosPaRin"
"Who's back here after seeing the trailer for his second interview with Toni on Sept. 13, 2022, exactly one year later?"
I have seen this many times.I can sense as I listen  to him  the humility  he has.  He is a very respectful man..a loving father and a caring husband.  I like the way he talks....so soft spoken..I am back to congratulate him for winning the presidency..I thank those who voted for him..God bless him as he heads the country to progress.
Your the best.. Toni G kung ano ka meron ngayon deserve mo Ô∏èÔ∏è
Bbm‚Äôs words was full if inspiration Makes me more proud to be a filipino
"Nkakaiyak tlaga, ramdam mo yung pagmamahal nila sa Pilipinas at sa kapwa Pilipino, Huge Congratulations po, naeexcite ako sa future"
"It's my first time to vote, one of the 31M Filipinos who voted for him. All I can say, he was a strong man with dignity and love to Filipino people and to the Philippines! 
#MarcosPaRin"
I dont know why Im crying watching his interview
"so much emotion in this interview  despite to what happened to them, they are still kind and most of all they  love filipinos ..."
Congratulations Mr. President.. ito ang nagpasimula ng lahat
"I am happy because with this simple interview, this is where the freedom of Filipinos from lies begins. We have long been mired in poverty and problems, and I see this as one of the ways for everyone to know that not everything a good person says is true. It is unfortunate because the debate and asking for sympathy from the people is repeated just to cover up the lies, so that the truth will also come out. It may take years but the real story will come out so I‚Äôm happy. I enjoy listening to stories from aunts, uncles and even my grandmother about how highly foreigners think of our country. Good things done by the Marks and things that prove we can do something. It is unfortunate because those who have not experienced Martial Law, they are still the activists who become the branch to spread more lies. The truth will really come out and it is already happening. You are my vote in the coming election. With or without an interview."
"You can feel the sincerity in his words, and how genuine he is. Also the way he speaks, it's all coming from his heart especially when it comes to his family, I really admire and salute you Sir. BBMSARA tandem is the best Ô∏èÔ∏èüáµüá≠"
"This ""heart to heart interview"" is really the eye opener to all. . . Great job Toni"
"Ang galing nyo po, Sir BBM! Kudos po to you! "
"I've learned a lot with this interview. Helping is his way of life.Im one of the 31M who love you Mr. President. Thank you for being the 17th President of the Philippines.. 
BBM-Saraüáµüá≠"
"Hindi nakakasawang panoorin 
Kahit paulit ulit paÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"

"Napaka humble talaga ng mga Marcos,...magaling Pati Ang first lady noon...Hindi lang paupo upo..nagtatrabaho din pala.."
I've watched this multiple times. Our 17th President really looks good in Pink. Kudos to Toni G!
my salute to my President Bongbong Marcos
One of my favorite vlogs to watch. I keep watching this again and again.
Nice interview Maam Toni and Mr.President Bongbong Marcos Jr. I salute you Mr. President
Smart and honest. He spoke from his heart. Thank you Toni.
Thank you Ms.Toni.... You're really brave
Came back here after watching Maid In Malaca√±ang with BBM‚Äôs narrative of who his father was. It was portrayed well in the movie and I thought of this interview while watching it.
How smart and articulated your words are.
Went back to watch this Video as it shows how genuine He is. I watched all the interviews or documentaries for BBM whether it be from His critics or supporter. I noticed that the critics shows negative side and does not see how good he is. I understand that being a critic is showing the negative part of someone. Yet it should also be transparent and show the good side of the subject. So it can be called constructive criticism so that we can get better result from the documentaries/interviews. Thank you for this interview Miss Toni Gonzaga for showing his side and his personality.
"The Lord choose you to Lead this country, God bless you, pumila ako ng 6 hours just to vote for you and Sara, while watching this video my tears flow, dami ko na learn lalo na ang pagpakumbaba, God bless you and I'm standing in prayers for you our dearest sincere president,"
Nakakaiyak Po Ang interview nyo na ito Kay Pres. Elect BBM .. sobrang naiyak Po Ako at sobrang ramdam mo Yung nararamdaman ni BBM .. Salute Po sa pagiging Matapang ninyo sa pagiging matiisin nyo sa lahat Ng mga bashers na yan sa mga anti Marcos .. nakaka proud Po kayo .. 
"The part that we never knew about the marcoses, i hope that everybody had pure heart and ears to listen what really happened that day"
This is a must-watch interview of BBM! prepare yourself before watching by making your mind open.
"I really idolize you Miss Toni Gonzaga, because you don't just vlog here on youtube, you don't just interview artists or politicians, but you do interviews to give them a chance to hear their side As a human"
"""History is written by the Victors"" and ""The Victors will always be the judge, and the vanquished the accused"". 
Let BBM redeem the rightful legacy of Marcoses."
One of the best interview that I‚Äôve watched here in Youtube Ô∏è
"I totally agree with you President BBM about your father. He's a great leader who's later on in his leadership was surrounded by corrupt elected official at that time. As for me growing up in poverty, I felt more secure during Martial Law. He was the greatest Filipino leader in my life time. Period!"
I'd watched it during the election and watching it now that BBM is now PBBM 17th President of the Republic of the Philippines. If PFEM is alive he be really proud of his Jr.
Mabuhay Ka President Bongbong Marcos. You are an epitome of a great person. Make Philippines great again!!!.
"This is so sad. We were so brainwashed for so long, this family have loved the Philippines so much and people turned their backs because of lies and deceitful people. I Love how he's campaign was focused on Filipinos winning not just about one person"
"If mananalo c BBM for presidency 2022 babalikan ko tong interview nya  ! 

And now His  elected as 17th President of Philippines üáµüá≠ 
Congrats BBM "
"I could just imagine how great the late pre.marcos as a father ,specially the father of our country ."
Kahit tagal tagal na to paulit ulit ko parin pinapanood c langgah2 ko Sir BBM...At nakakaiyak mga sagot nya dto kay idol tony God is good tlga God continue guide u Sir BBM ILOVEYOUU FROM MY WHOLE FAMILY ..And always watching from hongkong  and follow your volog Sir BBM and also kay idol tony...
"Hindi ako nagkamali sa binoto ko, salamat din sa magulang ko na minulat kami sa katotohanan sa magandang nagawa ni late President Marcos Sr. Na bata palang kami ikinukwento samin ang pagiging mabuti ni Marcos Sr. sa mga pilipino kaya iginagalang ng ibang lahi at isa sa pinaka mayamang bansa ang pilipinas noong panahong iyon.  I'm looking forward na ipag patuloy ni BBM ang magandang nasimulan ni PRRD.."
"Looking back at this interview 8 months later, He already projected in his thoughts and words all the qualities of becoming the 17th President of the Philippines.
Ô∏èüáµüá≠"
So proud of you President Bong Bong...Continue your dad's mission to make Philippines a better place to live.
"""I am a Filipino and Im proud to be one"",  salamat BBM"
I am very happy that our country is in goods hand again thanks to PRRD you're the one who started it all. Congratulations to President Bongbong Marcos Jr. and VP Sara Duterte hoping that both of you succeed in this admin I will give my full support to both of you until the end =)

The best interview ever 
I love you my President. Looking back at this interview now naiiyak ako. Your father is very proud of you Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
never ako magsisisi na binoto ko si BBM Ô∏è
"I love this kind of humble interviews, may respeto sa isat isa. Ngayon ko lang ito napanood, tama pagboto ko. Not like those interviewers, those media personalities na sumikat at nagkamal ng pera dahil sa mga matatalas na dila at mayayabang na tono ng salita nila, nakakapag ingles lng e feeling genius na. Aber, kung feeling matalino at magaling kayo, kayo nga magpatakbo ng bansa, ang yayabang e, puro magaling lang magsalita, wala naman naitutulong tunay sa bansa. Saludo ako kay BBM."
31million + has written what in their HEARTÔ∏èüáµüá≠HAPPY AND PRPUD TO SAY IM ONE OF THEMÔ∏è
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos I cannot hurt them now"" Ô∏è"
"This is one of the awakened interview for Fili[ino""s ,I Salute you President Ferdinand (Bong Bong) Marcos The Nation DEPEND ON YOU We believed you! We trusted YOU!.Thanks Toni Gonzaga"

"Im believe that he is the best, but thankful at the same time that im not with his time because of whats happened before. But in this modern generation im very grateful that Marcoses came back and i will be experiencing marcos regime.
Godbless your whole family and the nation Ô∏è"
WE LOVE YOU SIR BBM OUR PRESIDENT ELECT...MABUHAY PO KAYO!!!!
People have so much respect and love for the whole family. They are just as appreciative as the filipino people who appreciates them for what they have done for the country.  They traveled the world and made us proud.  What they did was priceless and is just as priceless till now..
"This is my first time watching this. I voted for him and he is now the new elected president. We love you mr. President. Please make this country great again, we are counting on you."
i can see the sincerity on him...he wants to continue the legacy of his father which brought our country at its best...sana naman yun mga kumakalaban pa sa kanila ay mag refrain na kayo instead help our government to improved and bring back again the lost time we had for the last 30years that we are in sink
I'm here againÔ∏è President Bong Bong Marcos thank you miss Toni Ô∏è
Nakakaproud maging Pinoy
"I am one of the 31M who voted for BBM!!!!! soooo PROUD and LOUD!!!! and I Love You, Ms. Toni G."
"Toni G you're indeed an example of a person of   good character and wisdom...i admire your kind of behavior which typifies a real filipina in the field of journalism and public discussion. You profess a well-educated and disciplined public icon in tv and elsewhere in other platforms. As a senior citizen and was born in FEM time i can definitely say that was the best time of my life. FEM had really instituted true discipline and love of our country whichbis exactly the opposite of his adversaries who wanted communism. i am proud to say that i am a product of Marcos era who lived in peace and harmony...where food is richly available at reasonable and affordable prices. i like his style of governance compared to the presidents of EDSA revolution who had duped the filipino youth of false accusations of the Marcos family. If FEM is not good for the agitators who had dabbed him as dictator, so be it. But young Marcoses should not be blamed for the father's misgivings."
Pang 10 beses ko na po pinanood..Indi makasawa..nakakaiyakÔ∏èÔ∏è
VERY INTELLIGENT MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN
Salute!!! Di boring ung interview at ung interviewer... Tagos sa Ô∏è... Di lutang sumagot!!! Congrats Mr. president!!!

Most watched politician on this channel so far. Maybe because the talk made itself more personal not political and his family's background is really interesting. 
""
Lots of wisdom here.The truth will always prevail
"The only leader we need to restore our pride, dignity,respect,& to boost the filipinos to help each other thru his visions & encouragements a leader who is calm, wise & a distinguish gentleman a perfect fit for a role model & of course to be the president that we all should have & learn."
So much loved this one on one talk of PBBM and TONI
"Thank you for this Interview Ms Toni , and Thank You for running as our President BBM. I hope you will continue your fathers legacy and make our country great once more . One of the good thing about our Late President Marcos was he Loved His country with all his heart , he loved filipinos . Revive Nationhood for us President BBM . your are 100% right we filipinos deserve so much more than just being second rate . Thank You in Advance President BBM Ô∏è"
"I completely agree with BBM, many Filipinos now lost that sense of being a nation, may i add patriotism or love of country, the essence of being a nation and unity. We must bring that back."

Galing nmn.. tagos sa puso ung mga sagot ni bbm
We can learn a lot from this interview. This is one piece of evidence that BBM was a truly deserving president.
"Like his Father FM ...
BBM is VISIONARY too.
And he has experienced what is like. 
That being with his father .."
"18:59 ""IF YOU'RE MAKING YOUR ENEMIES ANGRY,YOU'RE DOING A GOOD JOB"" this line hits different"
"I like the comfort that he feels in this interview.. no stuttering nor stammering, simply because he trusts Toni.. he knew that the interview will not be biased.. Toni asks questions same as the other interviewers do making sure that the words she'll use will not sound like she's interrogating him.. rather, she made sure that the interview will be more conversational in a professional way.. "
"My heart broke!!!!!!! ""I have spend my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down we're not shooting anyone."" Only History can tell and this is it now!!!!!!!"
"Naiiyak ako habang pinapanood ko..ito elementary days kopa..I'd still  remember ..na si pre,marcos  daw di mabuting  leader ng..bansang  pilipinas!!pero now..wow amazing..nawala man ang father  mo..pero tumatak nman ngyon sa isipan namin at namulat kami sa katotohanan..na napakabait at napakagaling na presedente  ng papa..niyo and now  your  finally  became  a present  ng pilipinas  were hoping  for  the  best  at alam Kong kaya mo,napakatotoo mong magsalita..ramdam kona totoo kang tao..GODBLESS ALWAYS..STAY SAFE  STAY  HEALTHY..ANG  PRESEDENTE  NG PILIPINAS..SALAMAT.."
"Please know that I have voted for you. I know that you'll be a great leader and commander-in-chief of the Philippines. We,  the majority of the Filipinos who voted for you, will support you all throughout. We can do this! We have to do this for the whole nation, for the Philippines. I never regretted casting my vote for PRRD back im 2016. I'm sure that my vote for you will not be wasted as well. Congratulations to our 17th President of the Republic of the Philippines. May God guide you as you lead our country."
bakit naiyak aku sa sinabi ni apo lakay na  he is defending filipino and i cant hurt them now  GODbless  always po  . we will support you now 
"Every enterview that Toni G. does..we always has this kind of  calmness and widom..she really listen and learn,not excited to throw questions but she knew when she would talk and ask... "
"When Mr. Marcos said "" I'm tired of hearing lies"". I really felt that."
"Every word Sir BBM speaks,i could feel his honesty,love and passion for his parents and everyone Ô∏èwhen he speaks about his dad,oh my i can feel his painand loveÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏ègod bless all marcosesÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
ive just watched his interview with kris on 'actually yun lang' which was aired 12yrs ago.all i can say is hids answers are consistent 12 yrs later..consistent but now with depth.
"FM love for the Filipino people was clearly shown on his last televised coverage st the height of EDSA, BBM has visions and had the best mentor growing up and Filipinos should put their politics behind and work towards what's best for the country."
"Love watching it again. 
Congrats po MR. PRESIDENT"
"BBM really deserves to be a president ..yan ang president matalino, humble and lovable "
"Very well said  . Kaya let us be united and help Mr. President na ibangon ang Pilipinas para wala nang Pilipinong mamamayan na maghihirap.
Phrases na tagos talaga sa buto:
""I have spend my whole life defending the Filipinos,I cannot hurt them now."" Great leader and full of Love."
"Im here in Canada
But my family voted for u
I love ur humility the most
You are brilliant"
May God bless and guide us all

Where u have so many memories with you Father 
Former President Ferdinand Marcos"
"Indeed Toni is one of the reason why Filipino's started to seek the truth. Congratulations to the both of you and Thank You sir Bongbong for not giving up to us. 

Remember: Those who wins the war makes the History."
I'm one of the 31 million voters who believed.. naniniwala po kami na ibabangon nyo ang Pilipinas.....will be here to defend and support government programs..
"Katatapos ko lng magparehistro..
For BBM nagparehistro tlga ako.
Sa tagal tagal kong hindi nakialam s pulitika, now i will vote..
Thank you for inspiring us BBM.."
"I'm here again, crying while watching this episode. Nakakaiyak sa sobrang saya na he made it. He's now our 17th President . He is really meant for the lucky number.  1957, #7, 17th....."
What the elect president BBM is absolutely true about how the Filipinos become known as from the Philippines. I remember my first year in the US when I was asked what nationality I was and I said I‚Äôm a Filipino from the Philippines and that person said where‚Äôs that at then later Philippines became known because of the late President Ferdinand Marcos being heard an intelligent and smart.
"Ang galing ni Ms. Toni magtanong di tulad ng mga taga bias media lalo na karen, mel , ressa, jesica at iba pa."
"This interview is one for the books! I 've watched in last year and watched it again, now that he is the presumptive president! Amazing!!! Humble, intelligent like Apo Ferdinand and he is proud to be a Filipino! We are proud of you, Mr. President!!!"
THE BEST INTERVIEW EVER!!!
I‚Äôm back on this interview to Congratulate our new President Ferdinand BongBong Marcos! Ô∏èI believe in what you can do for the country‚Äôs progress and most esp for the filipinos. I am excited to visit Philippines soon under your governance.

"This beautiful family is very kindhearted,very humble and very down to earth po.Mabuhay po ang Marcos family.Salute you po sir"
"11:03 this is very touching, marcos has a power to defend but he didnt resist back and instead.give way to the enemy who are the filipinos. he give way.."
May 2022: Things got into its places today and we've been thankful that Toni did this. You really deserve where you are now President BBM 
Love u Mr.PresidentBBM  Thanks God Dininig nya ang aming Panalangin na ikaw ang Mggng Leader ng Pinas at ikaw ang Magpapabago ng bansa ....Godbless u po At Marcos  Family 
"This is the only 2022 Candidate who doesn't need to say something against his opponents or backlash people who purposely wage vendetta over marcosses. He is the only 2022 Candidate that never looked down on filipino people -- he did see our potential, he don't pity us! His intention is to unleash the bestest in every life of filipino people. Isn't it amazing that this man didn't use flowery words to seek attention but simply stated the whole truth?"

"Watching this bcoz I got curious about BBM, this video would be better if it will circulate on FB to deliver good message to other anti-marcos, for them to realized that he is a good man. Ô∏è #BBM "
Andito ako ulit para panoorin toÔ∏è
"Watching this interview makes me envision another Marcos as a President, what i saw before was only the siege of Malacanang ousting President Ferdinand Marcos. It is vague to me but let us open ourselves to the options at hand, Toni just gave us a glimpse. And Kudos to her."
Very genuine..Good luck and God bless our President..üáµüá≠

I can't imagine what FEM must have been feeling to be shunned and banned from the people and country that he loved and cared. To be humiliated like that. Shame on the people who did this. I hope the Marcos and along with the country will be vindicated by what happened 35 years ago. 
"I love this interview! 
The ""man in pink"" "
Part two please. Darating and panahon na matatauhan ang mga anti marcoses. At mamahalin nila ng lubusan ang Marcos lalo na ang Late President FEM .

MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS üáµüá≠
"My prediction came true, destiny is fulfilled. #PBBM Ô∏è"
We Love MarcosÔ∏è
I just don't understand how some robots say this is one of Toni's most controversial interviews when Bong Bong is this great.
THANK YOU PO BBM NA IKAW ANG AMING PRESIDENTE.
"I didnt vote you as my President pero one thing is for Sure, meron Plano ang Diyos para sa Pinas kaya ikaw ang Nilagay niyo to Lead, Napaka sarap lang rin Pakinggan how you Uplift the Word Filipino or Pinoy na you'll feel its your Pride, the way you talk also is very Genuine and you'll see a Vision on Him his plans for the Philippines, God bless your Leadership and God be with you President BBM."

I was 19 yrs old that time and Ik what's happening. I cried when they left Malaca√±ang.  I don't see anything bad during his father's regimes. He was the best president I knw.  Only those activist hated late Pres. Marcos.
"Therefor, the more engage yong isang leader sa community mas lumalawak yong kanyang pag iisip about the social issues and concerns and eventually come up with something to address them. Kaya sana may ipalabas na batas , election gudiance na dapat yong tatakbong official ng gobyerno is yong may community engagement hindi lang isa, dalawa, tatlong taon but more the better.

"True Leaders are rare in this world. PBBM is right there is so many critics being in public service even in private life as well, either you do good people are still looking the negative output and it is normal in being human. Even in Bible history one of the great leader King David also have negative criticism. It doesn't mean they are perfect they also have shortcomings. But looking forward and leave the past behind is a best ethics every person must have we learn from it. We cannot turn back time and we still have future ahead of us to be more productive and be optimistic even in hard times... Just never give up and trust God for change... "

I would really love to have that nationhood back in our country. Where people would support locals more than anything else. We should promote the treasure we have in our country and in our people.

Some Filipinos were criticizing why Imelda Marcos was always crying. Now you know. Can you imagine being called all sort of vicious names and sued 900 times after you‚Äôve done ALL your best to help as many people as you can? üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠

Watching this interview again. ü•π
"BBM is a genuine man who cares a lot, to Filipino people!!! Kudos to Marcos Ô∏èÔ∏è"
the best thing that you could do is to help other people as much and as many as you can and nothing could be better than that - bbm
I wasn't Born during the time of FEM  but watching Sir Bong right now I shed tears thinking of how pain and some people cancelled them. I grew up thinking that they were cruel and now that I am in the state where I can distinguish what is truth and lies. I just cried while watching sir Bong.
15 million views and counting. Sana ma share ito para magising ang mga natutulog na isip ng mga nagra rally sa labas na ipinaglalaban ang mali. Since 2016 PRRD to BBM 2022.  now i can say im proud to be a filipino.
You're guided by the spirit sir.
Sino napaiyak din dito 
"Congratulations  to our new president and vice president,the Uniteam,answered prayers,so proud of u Toni and family u did a good job..MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS.."
so proud of you mr.presidentÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
"Considering it is my first time to vote, my heart and decision as a youth will greatly affect my future. You have my vote sir! I remember when I was in 9th grade puro negative ang naririnig ko ab Martial Law hindi ko alam kung ano ba dapat yung paniwalaan so I ask my lola kasi naabutan niya yung panahon ni Marcos. Tinanong ko siya lola bakit nakakatakot daw noong Martial Law? And the only thing I remember what my lola said is that matakot ka kung may mali kang nagawa at against ka sa pamahalaan"" Kaya siguro puro paninira sila ngayon kay BBM dahil natatakot sila. I hope he could continue the unfinished legacy of his late father. And that is making the country better. You have my vote sir! "
Watching this interview...wow he is no doubt an intelligent manÔ∏è
Binalikan ko to after 8 months and after the elections. True to my first comment president BBM thanked you for spearheading his presidency bid. Congratulations for your courage to stand up high to fight for what you believe is right despite the criticisms and cancelling of your co artists. Mabuhay kayo Toni G and direk Paul. Mabuhay ang Pilipinas

Watching Again this Video That he is now the President of the Philippines üáµüá≠Ô∏è.
"I was born 1987 but my Parents informed that President Marcos was one of the best Lider in our country Philippines.Ang Nanay ko hindi nakapag tapos ng Pag aaral pero Bukas ang Kaisipan nya sa lahat  ng Judgemental na tao ang naririnig nya raw  na masama sa Marcos ay hindi lahat masama o totoong masama. Minsan depende nalang talaga sa Nagbabalita at sa Pananaw ng Nagbabalita.Kaya now i realized bago ako makinig sa mga Balita sa Telebisyon,Radyo at higit sa Social Media.Susubukan ko muna makita ang Katotohonan hindi lahat ng Balita ay totoo‚Ä¶Sabi nga Too see is what you believed."
The late President Ferdinand Marcos Sr is the Best president we ever had and his son Bongbong will follow his footsteps. God Bless BBM!
"I don't regret voting for him as President of the Philippines.  Also, among all the sitting Presidents in the Philippines or even in other countries, there are people who do not want him to be the president of the country.  His political opponent or those anti-supporters who hate him, they will do things that are not good for him and spread false news using social media or television to destroy the person they don't like.  As we always tell ourselves and the person we admire, WE ARE NOT PERFECT."
"And now he's our president!!! Congratualation again ferdinand bongbong marcos jr. 
You are pride of our country!
Goodluck keep it up!
We're all Loving & Supporting you!"

"I think the best of Bong Bong was being a Pilipino, all the character and qualities of a Pilipino he just said and acknowledging those, knowing who and what are Pilipinos are makes him the better choice."
"that's why Filipinos chose you to be the president and still supporting your family because you are the true leader who genuinely love the Philippines  and its people . I am greatful because I was enlightened know the truth about  marcoses not unlike before  . May God bless you , guide and protect you and your family"
"it‚Äôs May 12, 2022 and you‚Äôre already our Presumptive President Ô∏èüáµüá≠ Thank you Toni, eto talaga simula kaya ako nagka interest ulit sa Phil Politics after migrating here in USA. Kung di dahil sa cancel culture na yan, di ako magiging supporter mo PBBM. Mahal ka namin Pops Ô∏è"
"Batang 90's ako and di ko naabutan si former pres Marcos but I believe he was really the greatest leader of our country. Why? It's bcoz I don't ask but many people around testifies, spreads willingly thru their own voices, own experiences, people who had used to live under his seat that he had so many succesful projects for the philippines. That all the awful hearsays, bashes about the Marcoses, those that are transcribed from the books, boradcast in social media channels are very far, far  from the truth. Even my uncle who worked from Korea told me that he koreans looked ao high of the Filipinos during FM administration."
Congratulations Mr. President! Ô∏è Thank you so much Toni 
Buti nalang nanalo kana genuinely honest and humble marcosesÔ∏è
"Watched this again today knowing that soon the Philippines will have Ferdinand Marcos Jr (BBM) as the new president.

Mabuhay ang Pilipinas üáµüá≠. Mabuhay ang bagong presidente at ang pangalawang presidente."
Ill always watch this BBM episodes .binabalikbalikan ko talaga.at sobra ang paghanga ko sa knya
"I support the other candidate but this made me cry and sad. When I saw the result sobra akong nalito kasi bakit nangunguna ka? but then I tried to research, watched your vlog, and observe the ppl who shared their stories noong marcos era esp. sa mga taong naranasan ang buhay noon. Ang masasabi ko lang he actually have a better plan for the country and ppl. I can feel his sincerity to serve us naman. I just hope ppl widen ther mindset and set aside muna ang hatred or anger at pakinggan ang side nila pero i'm not forcing anyone ha. Sana lang hindi masayang boto ng fam and relatives ko sainyo, they rlly adore and brag marcos family i swear."
Keep healthy Mr. President so you will be able to bring the Phil. What we have . Thank you for loving and serving our country
Re watching. Congrats to our new president! Ô∏è
"All i can say is FED was the best president that the Philippines that we ever had next to PRRD . WHY?? Because when i left the Philippines in 1985 , the country was peaceful and quite and fully developed but when i went back in 1989 , it was so messy. PRRD put back what FED had started little by little . It is my honest convection that BBM will continue what his late father FED plans for the betterment of all the Filipios and our Motherland. BBM-INDAY SARA are the ""CHOSEN ONES""."
we love you our President. You have such a kind heart that you caught 31M people and some more Millions who were not able to vote. and you have so much patience. All your words make sense.   Make this country great again.
naiiyak ako sa interview na to  ramdam mong totoo yung sinasabi ni MR. PRESIDENT  ang tagal nating naging bulag AT NGAYON BABANGON ULIT

My heart Ô∏è And i'm crying 
"i love marcos family
i love former first lady
and i love u toni"
"I remember, months before the election. This is the first video I just watched about bong bong Marcos because I have no other idea who he really is aside from he's the son of first lady Imelda Marcos and former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr.  

And as this video goes minute by minute, I just realized something new when ever he talks and he talk humbly. Dun ako napa wow.  When he talks, he has no yabang in him. He speaks with his heart and telling a story of his family and experiences in a humble way. That's when the time I got curious more about BBM and I watch mostly of his interview, vlog etc. I just found myself he is very inspirational when it comes to speaking. He is a natural speaker. Wala talagang yabang and all."
i rewatched it after Mr. Bongbong Marcos turns into Mr. President Ferdinand Bongbong Marcos Jr.
I could see the sencerity and humility in every word he apeaks! I know the philippines will rise again through the leadership of BBM and PRRD. Can't wait to see both of them in position.
"Helping people  is the best that you can do , Napakahumble mo po"

Came back here to relive the past before he becomes our newly elected president!! This video are one of the reasons why I voted him. Genuine person. Goodluck our new president!! Wag mo kaming bibiguin!!!

watching this again after election. Ô∏è Congrats President BBM Ô∏è
I think kahit nanalo si BBM hindi na siya mag focus na linisin or ibahin mga nasa history na sinasabi about them.Focus siya kung paano niya matutulungan mga Pilipino para kahit paano gumaan ang buhay din ng kababayan natin.31million trusted him.

"This is 3rd time to watch this, hndi ko mapigil ang lumuha feel ko ang feeling ni sir BongBong ang about his father naiiyak nga din ako. Kahapon May 10 2022 1day after election. Marami akong narinig against sir Bong pero mas marami akong narinig na Likes and Loves to Marcos Family. Nakita ko sa infront ng comelec hndi nila matanggap ang pagiging loser pero mas marami ang nagdiriwang sa success as Pres.ni sirBong. Glory to God in the highest ! Kahit puyat nong bilangan magdamag masaya naman ang kalooban sa dami ng Prayer nila Bro.Mike Velarde , Pastor Apollo Quiboloy , mga Ministro at members ng INC mga Prayers ng mga supporters talagang aswered prayers tayo. The best quality of Pilipino nagdadamayan . Kahit matagal na itong interview na to marami at marami pa rin manonood sa ToniTalks channel na ito at mababasa nila ito.

Watching this for the 4th time. Congratulations to our dear President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr. We will support you po all the way!
Where it all started.
"I was not born on Marcos era, but I know that the late President Marcos was doing a very good job based on what he is done to the Philippines and other countries also knew about it. Also, I knew he's a good father, hearing from the stories of his own son. But sadly, some of us (Filipino people) doesn't know about it because of the lies and hatred from other people. And until now, even the youngest era of our time was manipulated by those lies. But seeing how President BBM manages all of this, I know that the truth will prevail because God have always fair judgement to good people. "

They don‚Äôt stoop down to unclassiness, they put all their energy to serve our country and our filipino men. Where does that classify the media or the other party? all they do is ensure on making Marcus-Duterte infamous all over the world, whereas Marcus-Duterte have made definite changes in our country for the better!"
This is why GMA and other mainstream media are furious. They can't get a one-on-one interview with BBM. 
"Bong bong was calm,smart and cool personality thats why I admire a lot.."
"Congratulations!!!you deserve to win President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr...."
Mabuhay po kayo Sir..BBM.ang aming bagong Pangulo ng Pilipinas..karapat dapat ka talagang mamuno sa aming Bayan..Binoto ka po namin dahil nakita namin sa yo na meron kng Kababaang loob..Tama sabi ng tatay ko noon na magaling mg leader ang yong ama..We love you !

The President (Pres.Marcos Sr.) we failed to protect. But we promise FEM that we will protect our president now (Pres.Marcos Jr.) Ô∏è.
Definitely born to be a leader since then.
nakakaiyak hays... 
"My grandfather was the chief of staff of the army engrs during that time, its true that FM ordered them not to shoot anyone. I was brainwashed by history books that the school teaches, i didnt listen to my lolo. But everything he told about during Marcos Regime was true. I supported VP Leni since but I am so grateful that I was enlightened about the truth just a week before election. My husband is also a military officer, i grew up in a military home my grandfathers and uncles are military officers, PMA graduate, I married a PMAer too, I was the only Kakampink in thr family they are educating me about this but I did not listen, only a week before election that I was deeply thinking about it and I vowed to support my husband as well as thr government. I found out the truth about everything and I voted for BBM and Sara, now I am happy. "
"10:59 talagang tumulo luha ko dito. I really had goosebumps hearing those words of former president marcos from his son. god bless you mr. president, ur a truly caring Filipino to your fellow Filipinos Ô∏è"
"‚Äú I have spent my life defending the filifinos, I cannot hurt them now.‚Äù 
Not that he was just a brilliant man he also has a beautiful heart. Genuine love for filifinos and for the country."
Now I came to know and understand the calmness of Pres. Bongbong in dealing with the mapanirang opponents of him. 
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you are doing a good job. If you haven‚Äôt made any enemies, you haven‚Äôt done anything.‚Äù Oh I love this! So on point!"
"And I'm watching this interview again, after he visit the tomb of the late PFEM today. Prolly, PFEM must be happy right now for the sweet victory of his only son. 
Congratulations our 17th President of the Republic of Philippines, Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr.,
I'm praying for the safety and the best for your administration including your whole family. <3"
"I still believe what I was taught about Marcos when I was a kid BUT say what you want about him, it is unquestionable how overwhelming Intelligent he was. To grow up with a father like that and seeing how he talks and acts must be amazing. No wonder BBM also is smart."
"wala akoang masabiüáµüá≠
mabuhay ka bongbong marcos!andami kong natutunan sa iyo!"
When he said the Filipinos deserves better than to be second class citizens. Naiyak ako.  I hope you can bring us there.
"As a history teacher, I know that Marcos was the best president the PH ever had, but as time goes by, the history is changing and makes Marcos a bad guy, just the same, since I know the truth I keep on teaching the truth and I never used the textbooks that spread misinformation about Marcos as a great president, the new president is another Marcos, if my grandfather lives now he would be very happy too."
"Going back here to Congratulate and Welcome our New President.

"""He had all the qualities of a good leader would have."""
Siya na ang susunod na presidente at proud ako dahil madami akong natutunan sa kaniya sa interview na to we love you Bbm and sara Ô∏è
I think his dad's last look means something. And maybe that means his only hope is his son to continue the legacy he started; to make the nation great again and to save the Filipinos from poverty in God's will and time.  He probably wished that his junior will lead us and free us from the Yellowtards who poisoned our young minds.
We always love you Bongbong!
"Salute sa iniinterview at interviewer.... Very good kayong dalawa... Speechless na ko..

"Damn imagine the burden, criticism that he  endured for a long year. What a great tenacity."
I Believe President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. And Im So proud of him.

I wish that our president can visit our place here in San Gabriel la union... We love marcoses so much....
"Wala ako masabi, kasi hindi pa ako ipinanganak non, pero naalala ko ang sabi ng tatay ko noong nabubuhay sya. Sa lahat ng prisedenteng nagdaan. Si marcos ang the best. Kaya hindi ako naniniwala na masama si marcos. Merong lang na mga taong naninira at gusto sila ang mamomono, kaya nga nila pinatay diba. Tapos kung ano ano pa ang mga paninora ang ginawa nila. Ganun talaga kahit bibliya. Nangyari na din ang ganyan. Kaya ang dapat gawin move on. Tanggapin ang katoto hanan na ang pinili ng Diyos parin ang magwawagi."
You deserved to be called as President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr.
He was forgiven already and let peace be the source  of harmony.
At my age now i knew how pres Marcos  manages the country during his time being agood leader and descipline man
"I want Toni Gonzaga to interview the former presidents of the Philippines that were still alive like Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and our beloved Rodrigo Roa Duterte to tell interesting stories in life and their honor when they became president"
"Napaka genuine and sincere. Congratulations Mr. President  To those who throw accusations against Marcos, he'll be proving u wrong."
"Sometimes, hindi natin maunwaan ang ways ng Diyos, pero tlgang and Diyos na din ang naglayo sa Marcoses hindi dahil sa kakulangan nya, pero dhil ung ang kalooban ng Diyos...or pwedeng npahamak ang pamilyang kung hindi sila inalis, but now the season is changing....sobrang dami ng pasakit ang naranasan ng mga Pilipino, its time naman na bumangon muli ang bansang Pilipinas, at sa mga yuyurak sa dangal ng bansang ito, Diyos na ang kalaban nyo...Time of darkness and time of light and hope...."

Marcos is a visionary who loves his country. There have been many lies perpetrated by the oligarchs and I hope Filipinos will no longer be blinded by those lies. #cleanelection
Alam mo ba na ang pangalan ng Marcos ay nasa kwento ng Biag ni Lam-ang? Grabe napanood ko yun sa vlog ni FeeLeap at sobrang nagulat ako. Try mo rin po hanapin kasi nakakagoosebump talaga.
I remember nung buhay pa lolo ko i asked him sino best president lagi nya sinasabi 'Marcos'pero nung nag aaral na ako puro negative tinuturo sa school..
"I'm not even a fan of him, but I feel his sincerity, the desire in his eyes to build a better future for our country. 

As he stated, he always tag along with his late father whenever they go out of the country for politics, don't you guys think his the best person to be our president? As his young age he is already exposed to this kind of environment, he even live at the palace when he was still 7.. kung OJT for president pa to.. sobra sobra na ang qualification niya. "

High school and collage days ko don ko nakilala kung anong klase tao si Marcos. Mga processor ko sabj nila npk galing at talino na  pres. Si Marcos.. Binaliktad lng dw siya ng mga tao na naiinggit sa kanya.

Based on my observation BBM loves his father much!. I like this kind of interview unlike the other media especially Jessica Soho so bias on him.

"Iam just 26 at di pa ako buhay sa panahon ng mga marcos pero naikwento sa akin ng lola ko kung gaanu napakasaya mabuhay ng panahong namuno c ex president F. marcos kasi subrang napaka mura ng mga bilihin at madami pag kaka kitaan lahat ay sagana at walang mahirap bago paman dumating ang martial law Kaya lang naman nag ka martial law ay dahil sa mga nasa likod ng mga rebelde na ayaw ng tahimik na buhay at pilit na gustong umangat ng walang ka hirap hirap. Ang mga totoong utak talangka.at kaya lang naman madaming naabuso ang mga sundalo noong panahon ng martial law ay dahil sila rin ay naka tikim din ng mga pang aabuso sa kamay ng mga rebelde at di na hawak yun ni ex president F. Marcos kasi hindi nya kuntrolado ang bawat isang myembro ng sundalo. At sana naman wag puro bad side ng mga marcos ang tignan kasi naka lipas na yun at madami rin na gawang mabuti sa bansa si ex F. Marcos kung di lang naging gahaman sa kyamanan ang first lady emelda marcos sagana sana ang bansa ntin ngayon.pero kahit ganun paman naka lipas na ang lahat at ang mga naapektuhan at naabuso ng panahon ng martial law ay million million ang nakuha ng mga pamilya nila kaya sana naman mag move on na ang lahat sa usaping martial law. Hindi sa ako ay nag mama galing ako ay nag bibigay lang po ng opinion at nakikita ko na kailangan ng ating bansa ang magandang pamamalakad ng mga marcos nagawa na nya sa ilocos bakit d natin bigyan ng chance na baka magawa nya rin paunladin ang pilipinas,. Itigil na sana ang pambabatikos kasi matagal ng wala ang ex President F. Marcos at ang pag kakamali ng isa ay hindi pag kakamali ng lahat. Minsan kung sino pa ang masama sa tingin ng lahat ay sya pa pala ang may mabuting kalooban at totoong tao. Thank you toni G for this video vlog"

"The best thing that you can do is to help people, help people as many as u can- BBM"
"That's how the interview should be, the fair ones, those who don't take sides, don't politicize"
Filipinos are the best and we are craving for the validation that we lost.and we know that we deserve better. this man still hopes that this nation has its way to the betterment through the govt. but for now the real problem is the people.
"The heart of a leader is being portray even in the last hour that Apo FEM  can't hurt the pilipino. In the truest sense he is the hero of edsa.
History now judges who is the best stateman and end the era of lies legacy that a marcos come back will bring this nation great again. "
"Buti nq lang nag ingay yun mga anti marcos na curious tuloy ako panoorin to, hala nagising ako sa mahabang bangungot ng pangloloko ng mga anti marcos. Nakakaiyak, ramdam mo yun sincerity ni bongbong sa mga sagot nya. Thank you toni for rhis great enlightening interview, salute to you!  Uulit ulit ko to panoorin. God bless everyone."
Listening to BBM parang gusto ko makilala c fernindand Marcos personally at maexperience being under his term.
"My boss  met the first lady Imelda and Pres. Ferdinand way back the 70's and to my surprise, they have a lot of good things to say about them. They say a lot of good things about  how has been the Philippines  at that time. The couple daw is good looking especially madam Imelda a lot of people wanted to take pictures with them. The Marcos family may have many bad critics. But there are also people who would say good things about them and most have met them persnally, not by reading newspaper or heared from someone else. "
"Marcos Said: ""If you:re making your enemies angry, you're doing a Good Job"""
i dont see anything wrong about this interview bbm stating how he define his father and toni ia so good in throwing follow up.questions 
‚Äúhe looked at you its because you‚Äôll be a next president someday‚Äù
"""i have spent my whole life defending filipinos.""
we cannot hurt them now.
put your guns down ang we're not shooting anyone"""
"""Thank you for taking the trouble"" more power TONI"
and he's wearing the color pink to show how equal he is with this election. great man!
"Now that Toni gets a lot of hate‚ÄùYou could say
She did a good job"
A very interesting interview with the most eloquent and intelligent personality in this genereation.
"Naalala ko nung elementary ako may libre kami pagkain, nung nawala si apo marcos, nagutom na kami."
"That is Tony's talk, she control her blog what she want to talk during the interview. That ist 
Mga kaloys BBM Ô∏èÔ∏è po tayo"
totoo nga ang sinabi ng lolo ko na mas pinili ni pres. ferdinand Sr na umalis sa pwesto kesa saktan ang mga pilipino. My family will vote you Marcos Jr.
"I belive Toni wanted to something deeper from the Marcoses. 
She has her own curiosity, or perhaps she's just so innocent that her naivety made her vlog very interesting. And her way of questioning is so natural! Kudos Toni, you are a genuine person. Keep it up!"
"Kung nabigyan ng dalawang pagkakataon ang mga Aquino, i think it‚Äôs time to give chance sa mga Marcos to prove ano ba talaga. And let us ‚Äúnew generation‚Äù to conclude."
"Di ko na kailangan panoorin dahil alam ko naman ang mga nagawa ni FM at Bbm sa bansa. Mrs ko nanonood ngayon.. napapaluha narin..
Good luck and God Bless PFM Jr."
Mas mayaman tayo sa Korea at Singapore nung panahon ni Marcos kahit ang military natin mas malakas kesa sa China. Di nila tayo mabully ng panahon ni  Marcos.
would love to see a movie series of marcos life story. He is probably stating facts here.
Miriam Defensor : PH in good hands if Bong bong marcos takes over . Way back 2016
Gising na po lahat BBM Ang the  best for president at Duterte..Yan Ang tunay na nag mamahal sa bansang Filipinas..kaya plsss gising na mga Pinoy....
"Parang naririnig ko na uli ang boses ng dating Pres. Marcos‚Ä¶BMM is a true gentleman, very calm.
Pag natalo pa c BMM, yan ang talagang dinala na."
"Never in the interview did she ever praised or even discriminate the Marcoses. Even did she put Marcoses on the pedestal.
The answer is based on the son's perspective of how his father's years of being a president."
Dahil sa ganda ng response ng viewers including ng bashers sa Interview na eto challenge kay Toni yung mga susunod nyang interview kung papano mas magiging interesting
"Grabe yung ginawa ng media sa mga marcos, ginawa silang masamang-masama sa tingin ng mga tao. May kamalian pero madami ding nagawamg mabuti para sa bayan. Very smart itong si bongbong hindi gaya ni leni na puro patutsada sa gobryerno pag nagpapa-interview. I want bongbong for presidency."
Marcos is a visionary who loves his country. There have been many lies perpetrated by the oligarchs and I hope Filipinos will no longer be blinded by those lies. @/cleanelection
"""I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE DEFENDING FILIPINOS, WE CANNOT HURT THEM""
"" MY ORDER IS TO DISPERSE THE CROWD WITHOUT SHOOTING THEM, NO, NO,NO, HOLD ON... DISPERSE THE CROWD, WITHOUT SHOOTING THEM."" -FERDINAND E. MARCOS."
I guess BBM sees that being a Public Servant is a lifetime calling.
sana manalo ang marcos - duterte sa 2022 para sa pag unlad ng pilipinas
Most liked na episode ng tonitalks.
"This is one rare interview of BBM where he was allowed to express himself and speak. No annoying interruption or rude, pathetic attempt   to attack him. Kudos to Toni for being a respectful interviewer.  I will definitely watch all her interviews."
"""The best thing that you can do is help as many people as you. What could be better than that?"" - Bongbong Marcos Ô∏è"
"SEEING THIS MAN MAKE ME FEEL SAFE ,SO HUMBLE ,IDEAL FATHER AND IDEAL LEADER OF THE PHILIPPINES "
This is the kind of interview that you'd want more. A part 2 perhaps? 
"Grabe !!! Naiyak ako sobra pooo. Walang sayang sa interview na to. Only pure and humble person sir Bong Bong is. Thank you Miss Toni to hear sir bong bong. Ikaw lang po ang nakita kong nag interview kay sir BBM ng walang pang huhusga. Ganito dapat mag interview!!!
#BBM"
"This video really touched me, in a way how Toni ask BBM and the way he answered, it was just simple but with a pure heart, we can really sense their being true people, full of positive vibes. I pray for BBM to win the Presidential election and lead our people sama sama sa hirap at ginhawa sa tulong ng ating Maykapal. Lord Jesus sanctify the coming May 2022 Philippine Presidential Election making BBM as our new President! Amen"
"Bumoto po tayong lahat sa darating na halalan at iboto natin si BBM! 
MAGKAISA PO TAYO! GODSPEED!"
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Äù- President Ferdinand Marcos"
"the way BBM praised us Pinoys made me teared up a little there ‚Ä¢ÃÅ  ‚Äø ,‚Ä¢ÃÄ"
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down we're not shooting anyone."" Indeed Marcos is a true hero!!!!"
"This is my 4th time watching this video and I honestly don't see any wrong on Toni's part. She asked the question and BBM answered it straightly. Toni did a great job here, I love how she executes and digs information from BBM."
This gentleman really deserve to lead the Philippines. The character that constitute of being a leader was on him. God bless this man and God bless our country.
"If you're making your enemies angry, you're doing a good job! But if you haven't made any enemies then you haven't done anything! Smart words indeed Sir Bong! #BBM #DU30"
"He definitely said it well ‚Äú the pinoys are hardworking so true,‚Äù Working abroad aint easy but we do it because this is the way we are ‚Äúhardworking‚Äù hindi umaangal kahit pagod na kumpara sa mga ibang lahi laging may reklamo pero tayo kahit pagod nandun talaga yung pagiging passionate natin sa trabaho na hindi sumusuko... napaiyak ako dun sa mga sinabi niya about pinoy sooo proud of being a pilipino working here sa abroad napakapagod na trabaho pero dahil passionate ako sa aking trabaho at dahil ako ay pilipino talagang hindi sususuko"
"""I spend my whole life defending the Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now."""
"I trust Ms. Miriam Defensor Santiago that's why I will vote for this humble man. Let's go Mr. Bong Bong Marcos! 

#BBMforPRESIDENT2022"
"I was still young at that time but when my grandmother and mother told me about the time when Marcos was the president, their lives were prosperous. five cents you have a lot to buy, you already have rice and a dish, it's not difficult to travel, the fare is low, especially when you go home to the province. the pleasure of listening to hear a story during the time of marcos was like the pleasure of life back then, even if it was simple. I don't know why I'm crying over the story of senator bongbong, it's like I felt like the Filipinos were alive then. life prosperous and happy."
"Finally the best interview is #1 trending now, you deserved  this toni .

Ang sarap pakinggan/ panoorin un interview na ito. Uulitin ko uli <3 Isa sa mga naiwan sa akin after watching this is the word nationhood. <3
im proud that my family never hated marcos even my grandparents we are all marcos in our familyÔ∏è
I like this interview. Even if Toni is not considered as a professional she managed to get BBM answered truthfully in my view.
"When i went to college, i keep on arguing with my grannies because they keep on saying that marcos is great and its the opposite that i had learned. And so, i realized or maybe my grannies were right. Marcos are great after reading and watching documentaries.  And now, watching this interview of my idol Toni.. I will surely VOTE for you Sir BBM. You are my PRESIDENT."
You can see the sincerity in his eyes.
"Toni is such a talented woman,who is professional and full of respect. I I we're her sister and parents, I am very very proud of her. Thanks a lot Ms. Toni for doing your job sensibly! Salute to you Madam!!!"
"I voted for him last 2016 election, so if Bongbong confirms his decision in running for Presidency I would vote for him. He knows well what he says."
I like how Toni throw every question. Hindi nagssimula sa negative. So fair and respectful.
"I was born three years before the Marcos Regime ended. I read history. But, after this interview I know who will be my 2022 president."
"the way he speak makita mo yong genuine  heart, napaluha ako.makita mo sa kanya na kahit hindi mopa nakilala the way he speak napakatotoong tao."
"Ganyan ang Tunay na Ama nga PILIPINAS proud pinoy/filipino at May Malaking Puso para sa Bayan. Kudos sa inyo Sir. At kay Miss Tony.

"Very Intelligent, Pure and straight to the point when answering questions... This kind of Man will be the next GREAT PRESIDENT WE SHOULD HAVE... Ô∏è"
I hope he could continue the unfinished legacy of his late father. And that is making the country better. You have my vote Sir.
"Never judge a person based from their family. He is extremely smart, articulate and very charismatic. I want him to sit in office. He has learned what to do and what not to do now. Far left is not ideal for Philippines."
"His qualifications, mind, educational attainment, personality, sincerity. They did not deserved to be bashed and treated like that. Indeed they were qualified for leading the country, for being in the politics. Etc. May we think critically on who to vote for this election. Facts and evidences are all over the social media platforms."
Magaling flow ng interview walang criticism sa kalaban but boosting the Filipino good traits
I love Toni Talks. Very unbiased. Go Toni G!
"I love this man, he has almost 70% characteristics of his father specially the tone of voice."
"When people are spouting lies don't think about it, you have the advantage you know the truth.
-BBM"
Brilliantly done Toni! Keep doing what you do best! Bashers will not stop bashing but your intelligent viewers know when to criticize and when to applaud. Thank you for giving us exemplary content. You're admirable!

3 times ko inulit ulit ung interview. Ang ganda na siguro ng buhay ntin ngaun kung nag tuloy tuloy ang mga planu ng dating late President Ô∏è BBM2022
Well done Toni.  Love all the questions your throwing to Marcos. It's so balance and BBM is answering from the heart.
Sobrang galing ni FM ...WLA PANG NKKPNTAY ... SA TALINO ... at galing... sa mga nagawa...
I became a fan since this interview.You‚Äôre brave! My deepest respect for you..
"""I think that Filipinos deserve better than to be second class citizens."""
"Miriam Defensor backed him up for a reason. Marcos is knowledgeable, he is up for what the job entails and has a great understanding of it. Wisdom and experience. He seems like he‚Äôll make a passionate leader and president. You can tell their difference from the past work they did and their interviews. I registered to vote for him."
"You could not see anger in his eyes, after what the people have did to them. They try to understand and move forward."
"a truly humble person, no promises made unlike other politicians full of promises to the upcoming election."
"This interview might bring him to be Philippines next president
Good luck BBM in 2022
And kudos Toni for asking the simple yet worthy questions, well done girl"

Kudos to toni!! The best "
"Balang araw ipapakita ko ito sa aking magiging anak na ito ang katotohanan tungkol sa mga Marcoses. Nawa'y lahat ng mga nalinlang noon ay matauhan na. Ito na ang tamang panahon para ibalik ang mga Marcoses sa Malaca√±ang. Thank you Toni for letting BBM to speak up. No biased, fair interview. Ito yung katangian ng isang mamahayag na wala ang ibang mga journalists. Pwe!"
"The best thing that you can do is to help other people, to help other people as many as you can. FOR ME IT IS A WORD OF A TRUE SELFLESS LEADER!"
"I grew up hearing bad feedback about his father, they always using the martial law  against his father but, in reality former President Marcos did a lot of good things and improvement for our country. I hate how people only magnify what happened in martial law, but didn't mention Marcos contribution to our country."
"That being visionary is truly one of the best characteristics of being a great leader. No wonder Pres. Ferdinand Marcos is the best President that Philippines has ever had. Marcoses are the truest pure and kind hearted people. I can sense that they don‚Äôt have hatred to the people, but only the people who led and started the propaganda to instill hatred towards the Marcoses have made the people angry to them. It seemed the Marcoses were betrayed underground by using those influencial people especially religious sectors which that time were very persuasive. "
President Ferdinand E Marcos is the brilliant and best ever  president in the philippines walang makakatalo sa kanya kahit sino man...if bongbong marcos run for president my vote for him...
This is got to be the best interview. Toni is very professional with her questions and response to bong bong. I gotta say. She's better than the journalist out there.
Yong goosebumps ko habang pinapanood to!‚Ä¶ BBM IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT
"This History of Marcos are really overwhelmingly more and very challenging. A lot of things happen after Former President Marcos that makes the country drops to its knee of poverty and corruption and drugs business. None of this Politician make an effort or talk, they are all part of taking opportunity taking advantage of making rich of conspiracy business. I Thank all the people that works to make things learn and progress of showing the true makabayan. The country needs to be change completely from all levels. It is time for Bongbong to fulfill the long awaiting ambition of his Father for the Filipino to be a Maharlika. To Tony Gonzaga, you are really one of the best Blogger. Everything is a Plan for you to be in the part of History. God Bless You. Take Good Care Always as we are expecting more from you. Thank God.for being very natural and normal Filipino. I can sense something more in your way."
"The Marcoses knows their truth; that‚Äôs why you never see them on national television begging sympathy from the public. The way he answered all the questions, direct and sincerely, shows his honesty. Usually kasi andaming drama ng mga sagot, Kala mo laging inaapi sa interviews, puro parinig sa kalaban. Wala namang sense."
"I will support this man ,even if I'm not ask to. Let's heal as one"
WE LOVE MARCOS FOREVER WHAT EVER HAPPEN NANDITO LANG KAMI PARA SA MARCOS!
Marcoses are GOD sent leaders

"""If you're making your enemies angry, your doing a good job"" marcos"
one thing for sure I trust senator Miriam Defensor Santiago on her choice.
"Ngayon ko lang ito napanood. Matagal siyang naka save sa watch playlist ko. And naku-curious ako kung bakit madaming nagagalit kay Mam Toni, may school pa na gusto siyang kausapin. Pati friend ni Mam Toni,  nagsabi na firm ito sa decision na hindi na muling iboboto ang Marcos. She even uses ""#NeverAgain"". Pati ibang kaibigan ko nagre-react dito. Madaming nagiingay sa FB at Twitter na against kay Mam Toni. "
"I was intrigued about the issue, so I watched it. Honestly, I see nothing wrong with it."
"Toni: What's your best quality?
BBM:  It's against my nature (proceeds to laugh) 
Authentic humility at its finest   a true quality of a leader. Not once did I hear him speak highly of himself and speak ill against other people. Doesn't promote hate peddling unlike those dilawans/anti-Marcos/propagandists who did nothing but hate, point fingers, and dwell on the kuno ""dark side of history"". First of all the "" sins of the past"" during Martial Law has been proven FALSE time and time again. There were no cases filed for the missing people or ""tortured ones"". The Martial Law was declared because there were growing threats of terrorist attacks, people were out of control, the oligarchs were controlling the land reform, groups were conspiring against the president (including Sisa and Ninoy Aquino). The severity of the situation at that time was the reason why Martial Law was declared. Without that law, we would have been like Afghanistan‚Äîterrorists being our leaders. Cory Aquino and the dilawans controlled the media and has their propaganda, heck they fooled people into believing Marcos was a bad president I included but not anymore. It's about time the truth comes out. Not the truth written in the history books by the dilawans but the real one. Thank you, FEM for your service and authentic care for the Philippines and thank you in advance to President Bong Bong Marcos for making the Philippines great again."

Loved this talk!!! "
He was family oriented. Yes he may lived a privileged life but turned out to be a humble one. TBH I find F.Marcos' family more decent than N.Aquino's

"I remembered my late father cried when Pres. Marcos was ousted because of the false narratives by NPA/LP. They witnessed the real and true history of Martial Law, he said, ""if you are a law-abiding citizen you will live peacefully, and if you are against the law then you are in trouble"". Pres. Marcos was a WWII veteran hero same with my father who fought against oppressors (Japanese and communists), and they will always be our heroes."

"Years before, I asked my mother how is it like to live under the Presidency of the late President Marcos, and she answered me that things were very great! They have good roads(which is not like today that repaired every election), the prices of necessities in the market and groceries were low, the cost of living before was not that high and bad, and there is a huge security and safety from NPAs."
THANK YOU SO MUCH TONI FOR GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO GIVE HIS WORDS OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCES.   
"The way Mr. BBM speaks is so sincere and it comes from his heart and mind, you can see how family Marcos loves all the Filipinos and our country as well, from what he shared, they never speak bad about their enemies, but instead they just focus on the work that needs to be done. Intelligent with the heart this is the kind of President that we need. #BBMismypresident2022 #votewisely."
The most watched interview of the year... We love you TONI... Go Go Go Toni... Mabuhay ang mga Marcos.. Agbiag ti solid north...
"You cannot fake sincerity and genuineness that comes from the heart. Sir Bongbong really speaks of truth. He spoke spontaneously with calmness, conviction and humility. Indeed, he is a man of integrity and wisdom."
This is the best impartial interview I have seen. Kudos Toni! You are a million times better than the other so-called journalists who are blinded by money and hate.
"""The best thing that you can do is to help other people, to help many other people, as many as you can"". As citizens of Philippine, we can be the best at just one thing: helping others, especially our fellow Filipinos."
He answered all those questions genuinely. His love for the country and fellow countrymen is way above beyond.   Let's make Philippines great again.
Napaluha ako sa pakikinig kay Bongbong Marcos. You can feel the honesty in his heart. Marcos pa rin. Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
This interview shows that democracy is working in the Philippines. Artists like Toni Gonzaga can talk to anybody without being pressured by somebody. Mabuhay ang Pililinas! Mabuhay si BBM.
"Every bbm's words spoke out I cried lalo na sa sinabi niya 
"" Yes, kung ito ang buhay ko mag serve sa Filipino people na ibinigay ng Diyos na nakatadhana para sa akin is I will ""
He has a true heart and mindset becoming a leader. He practically point out the truth of what is today's our country is striving and facing for corruption of having not a matured leader who will bring out the Philippines into a brightest future na kung natuloy pa ang kanilang plano para sa atin is wala na sanang kababayan natin na kapos at hirap na hirap sa pagsasakripisyo para sa ikagiginhawa dahil kulang tayo sa isang leader na may totoong puso at pagmamalasakit sating kapwa Pilipino at ito ay si BBM. And also thank you for @tonistalk for the interview para mamulat ang sambayanang Pilipino sa katotohanan at isa naku dun!!!"

I was born in 60's at naranasan ko ung kabataan na si Marcos ang pangulo Kaya ung mga batikos sa kanila, isa ako sa mga nanggagalaiti sa kanilang kasinungalingan. May mga mali man siya at di ko naiintindihan pa noon pero naranasan ko kung gaano siya kahusay na pangulo . Maraming naluko itong administrasyon ni Aquino... kawawa ang mga kabataan  sa panahon ngaun ay patuloy na naniniwala sa mga negatibong propaganda about Marcoses. "
"He's just talking about his relationship with his father, and that's something we should admire. Ô∏è"

That sense of nationhood just hit me‚Ä¶ it brought tears that I was able to found the words on how I am feeling as Filipino and we should represent ourselves abroad.
"My mom tell me a story how our president FEM helped my Lolo's during that time. She said that my lola got illness and needs an operation immediately but my lolo had no amount of money for the payment. He is only postman didn't had enough salary to pay the hospital bills. Because of his work, he decided to make a letter addressed to the office of the president and sent it to the office. After few weeks, my Lolo's  received the money. He was surprised that our president that time made an action on the letter. He is very thankful  because of that my lola's extend her life. I will never forget the kindness of president did to our family."

"In Singapore, local old folks knew the Marcoses, they never said a bad thing about them. specially PFEM, sabi nila ang ganda nang Pilipinas noon panahon ni Marcos, sobrang unlad nang Pilipinas, isa sa mayaman na bansa."
Kept watching this interview over and over again.. This is the story of Marcos.. Respect..
I am only 2 years in Philippines and I start to have a clear view about the beautiful country and at this point of time the country need another Marcos like your father been. Good luck and I wish you the best and I feel like you are the best choice to lead the country and for the best of the Filipino people.
"He was right in saying 1: "" when others keep repeating lies enough, then it becomes the truth!"". 2: ""if you make your enemies angry, you're doing a good job!"" Brilliant mind!!"
"My parents left the Philippines during the Martial Law, we grew up here in the states. As growing up my thinking was that Marcos is a dictator portrayed by both Pinas and US mainstream media. After watching this interview and the backlash towards the host, it really dawn on me that the Marcoses are not bad at all. It showed that BBM's being a humble person. I think many doubters like myself had change my perception about the Marcoses. Thank to you Ms. Toni Gonzaga for that great interview. Mabuhay ang Pinas."
"We can't deny the fact that despite of issues  of his father still the Marcos are truely great servants, not only that they are smart and elegant. "
"I have goosebumps listening to Him, mature and has the sense of responsibility, raised with breed."
"This the best Interview i ever heard .. Toni shows how professional she is as well as BBM enjoying the flow of the whole convo,."
"I admire and love the way he talks.
The way he answers questions was eloquent.
Naiyak ako sa part na kinukwento nya yung moment when his father passed."

"The very good thing I liked about Toni's vlogs is that the guest ALWAYS HAD THE FLOOR, unlike the other vlogs where the questions lead to certain issues that lead to the interviewer's own opinions. Congrats, Toni; you're really subjective!"
"In behalf of Lorenzo Nacu, my Lolo. We will support you all the way to the president. Lorenzo is the one who saved your Dad at the time of war. Your Dad find us and help all of us. We are your loyalist and we will bring the Philippines back to where it should be during your Dad's regime."
"I remember the day na kinukwento ng nanay ko ang mga nagawa ni Marcos which is napakabuti at napakaganda ng pagpapalakd ni Marcos nung mga kapanahunan nila.

"By far the best interview I‚Äôve ever seen. No bias, no malice, no hidden agendas. There are 3 versions of the truth, the Marcoses side, the other side and the real truth. Many, if not all of the cases against them reached the supreme court were dismissed due to lack of evidence. What‚Äôs wrong with BBM saying that we deserve better than to be treated as 2nd class citizens; That filipinos are the best; That we need discipline. Do not let your hate overwhelm your humanity (taken from BBM‚Äôs interview with Erwin Tulfo)."
"My vote for you isn't enough ,i will pray for you and for our country's victory .Salute to you, our President to be"
I‚Äôm 35 years old now. Never voted for my entire life since wala akong interest sa politika. Dahil sa daming chika about this interview. Na curious ako. I‚Äôve watched and read videos/articles about this. Both anti and pro Marcoses. Pansin ko lang na puro accusations lang yung mga anti. Yung mga pro is may mga proof. Isama mo na yung mga statements nung mga dating Anti. And parang wala akong napanuod na nag bad mouth mga Marcoses sa mga kumalaban sa kanila. Na engganyo tuloy ako magparehistro. I‚Äôm just hoping na ituloy ni BBM yung pagtakbo niya na presidente. He will definitely get my first ever vote.
"I was crying while i‚Äôm watching him, he is really a true person. :‚Äô("
"I have grandfathers na part ng military time ng Marcos regime and they were always telling us stories of Marcos leadership.
Pero ang fave nilang ikwento yung time na handa na daw sila na pasabugin ang edsa but Marcos never gave them the go signal kahit pinipilit na ng chief of staff na pasabugin na, but it never came bec Marcos loved the Filipino people and would never wish harm to his countrymen."
"I always had a close encounter with sir bong bong back in 90's. Loyal customer namin sila sa ACA VIDEO greenhills. Very kind and patient yan. Ndi sya kagaya ng ibang customer na napaka mainipin at dominant. Lagi nyang sinasabi "" im okay here..please take your time.""habang nanonood lang ng movie sa side. Pag ang mom nya ang nagrerent samin nasa loob lang sya ng car na nakapark talking to her body guard at yung body guard nya ang magsasabi samin kung ano gusto nyang irent na movie.  Super humble ni Sir bong bong at mabait."

I was able to watch Edsa 1 live telecast during that time.  I remember when Pres. Marcos was seating at the table and in front of him was then Chief of Staff Fabian Ver who was waiting for his instruction. Ver says they already got  two fighter planes flying now to strike at any time. However, Pres. Marcos order was not to attack. Even if there were lots of civilians gathered already, still his order was to disperse the crowd  without shooting them.  And if it is true that he was a dictator,  maybe those people who participated were long gone now.  And now, it's BBM's turn to prove his leadership!  "

Ito yung interview na nakakaiyak...Mafefeel mo talaga na sobrang humble at disiplinado ang taong to.
"The sad part was Marcos love the filipinos so much that in the end he got betrayed by his own people. But despite of all that they still want to serve for filipinos, very patriotic and intelligent family, and I admire them for that."
"Alam niyo napansin ko lang may isang ugali ang mga marcos o kahit si BBM lang, na hindi makuha ng karamihan satin lalo na ang mga kalaban niya sa politika. Yun ay ang maging laging kalmado sa lahat oras o hanggang kaya huminahon at kumalma, sobrang haba ng pasensya. Oo di ko inabot ang panahon ng tatay dahil bata pa rin ako 20yrs old only. Pero ayun ang pinaka napansin ko sa kanya since nung past 2016 election. Debate w/ other na running for VP laging kalmado kahit tirahan ng tirahin ng kalaban o kahit anong ibatong totoo man o hindi na sinasabi ng kalaban, kasi di natin alam ang nangyare noon katulad ko dko alam nangyare noon kasi syempre bata pa nga ako. Pero talagang nakukuha niya ang loob ng katulad ko kahit onti pa lang ang nalalaman ko, nababasa ko at nireresearch ko mga kabutihang ginawa nila sa bayan at bansa natin. Kahit mas marami ang nakikita at nababasa kong naninira sa kanila, ewan ko kung fake news ba o kwentong kutsero ba ang ibinabatong salita o binibintang sa kanila/pamilya niya. Pero still gustong gusto ko siya para sa bansa natin. Kumbaga kobinsadong kumbinsado ako sa kanya para manalo kahit ganon. Rehistrado nako nung 2019 at mag 21 this November at dati dko alam kung para saan at nagparehistro ako bilang botante, ngayon alam ko na kung para saan. Sa darating na eleksyon si sir Bongbong Marcos ang iboboto ko sa pagka presidente."
"I don't see anything wrong with the interview.   Bongbong Marcos is being true to his answers.  Toni did a great job as an intwrviewer.  Questions that was asked has nothing to do defending the Marcoses...  Ms. Toni, you are correct!!!  You don't have to prove or do anything defending yourself.  You know who you are."

Wow. I was amazed by those words. Kung ibang presidente yon baka gulo talaga nangyari non."
Since bata ako never kung kinamuhian yung tatay nya. Lagi kase syang kinukwento samen ni inay lahat ng kwento nya is yung good side about marcos at yung mga nagawa nya. Buti nalang bobo ako nung elementary wala pakelam sa sibika at kultura kaya hindi nakatatak saken yung mga kasinungalingan ng mga nasa libro. Mas naniniwala padin ako sa nanay ko at sa mga sinasabi ng matatanda. Minsan kase mas pinaniniwalaan naten yung sinasabi ng iba kesa sa nakikita ng ating mga mata. kaya ang ending hindi maganda. Binoto ko sya for VP nun pero hindi sya nanalo sana this time hindi sya dayain.

Nung Bata ko nabasa ko sa libro ng Araling Panlipunan na diktador daw po si late Ferdinand Marcos na masama daw siya. Kaya pag-uwi ko sa bahay nun tinanong ko ulit si lola at lola kung talagang masama nga si FM nuong siya ay presidente pero ang Sabi nila siya daw ang the best president Kasi nuon sobrang mura ng bilihin at may libre pa daw silang feeding. So Sabi ko kay lola bakit yung sa libro ganun ang sinasabi kay FM. At ngayon malaki na ako ngayon ko narealize na ang libro at media ay bias at di totoo mga sinasabi. This is a wake up call sa ating mga Pilipino na ang mga Marcos ang hindi magnanakaw at masama bagkus sila ang tunay na mabuti ang hinahangad sa ating mahal na Pilipinas. Kaya sir BBM kung tatakbo ka man po bilang Presidente next year nasa iyo po ang aking boto. I can see in your eyes the genuine and love for the Filipino people and the Philippines. Alam ko.magiging magaling kang presidente in the future katulad ng iyong yumaong ama. Kaya.please lang mga kapwa ko Pilipino iboto natin ang nararapat at tunay na may magandang hangad sa ating mga Pilipino.

Tahimik lang tayo sa media but we all know his family has A LOT of supporters.
"Sa like pa lang makikita mo ng madaming nagmamahal kay BBM. Nagparegister ako last week, at ang kauna unahan kong iboboto ay si BBM. Lets make the Philippines Asia's Tiger again."
"You can see that Bongbong speaks with the use of memory and we all know that a person who speaks with the use of memories speaks the truth. He moves freely while he talks riding with the emotions that he remembered from his past which means that it really did happen. He is so soft hearted, gentle and kind in which traits that his father had taught him. VOTE FOR BBM TO BRING BACK PHILIPPINES BACK TO ITS FORMER GLORY!"

Nakakatuwang isipin na boto si sen. Mirriam Santiago maging si Pres. Duterte kay BBM. Sana maging mulat at mapanuri ang mga Pilipino sa pag-boto ng magiging Presidente. Sana hindi yung presidenteng tumakbo lng dahil kinakalaban ang Marcos, hindi dahil gusto LANG tumulong sa mga mahihirap at hindi magpasikat lamang.

"""If you're making your enemies angry, you are doing a good job""

I love this! Ô∏è"
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I can not hurt them now."" ""Put your guns down, we're not shooting anyone."" <3"

Salamat mam toni

""sometimes people they dont want to hear the truth because they don't want to destroy their illusion"""
"I remember how many times I defended (and will always defend) the Marcos family, especially ang dating Pangulong Ferdinand Marcos,   sa mga classroom debates namin na related sa politics and presidency. My teachers were trying to make me believe kung ano ang nakasulat sa libro, but they can't deceive me. I know the truth since my parents and relatives always remind me what really happened back then. It's time for change. Let us support BBMÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"Toni: what is it that you want to continue doing?
BBM: Helping. Just make the Philippines better.
Yan ang tunay na may malasakit at pag mamahal  sa bayan.üáµüá≠üáµüá≠Ô∏è"
"Ganito dapat ang interview, malumanay, may sense ang follow up questions, attentive ang interviewer at walang pinupush na agenda, hindi tunog nang iinterogate (pasintabi sa mga journalists/anchor na maka ask ng question akala mo mga husgado), there's mutual respect and questions are not aimed to humiliate the guest. Hindi tunog nakikipag debate. KUDOS to Toni! "
"I‚Äôve been reading all the comments. It seems like Toni has made such a huge impact on how the Filipino people are going to vote this time. Thank you Toni for being the catalyst in this seemingly complicated issue on who to vote, especially because a lot  of the Filipino people vote according to who‚Äôs popular or trending ( hint: Pambansang kamao). 
I hope the Filipino people will vote wisely this time. I was born before Marcos became president in 1969. The country was great back then, and then the Coquangcos took over. However, it was revealed that the oligarchs of Tarlac were actually corrupt and were being portrayed as victims when they were, and still are, villains. Ask the tenants of their hacienda. They will tell you of the killings. It‚Äôs about time that we vote wisely. Bangon Pilipinas!!!"
"Habang pinapanood ko tong interview na to, isa lang ang sumagi sa isip ko. Yun ay yung napakadaming nasayang na panahon na sana naging mas better ang bansa, kung sana nabuksan na ang isip ng mga tao noon sana naging mas maayos tayo ngayon. Hindi ko naabutan ang panahon ni late Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, pero to think na hanggang ngayo  ay binabanatan pa din sya ng mga anti/kalaban nya ay isa lang ang ibig sabihin, naungusan nya lahat ng kalaban nya kaya galit na galit sa kanya or sa pamilya nya. Nakakalungkot lang kase nagpabulag ang karamihan noon sa panahon nya pero sabi nga lalabas at lalabas din ang katotohanan. Hindi pa huli ang lahat! BBM for President 2022!!!"
Every words he says has a sense. Very intellectual and with a heart.
"Naiyak ako dito "" I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now ""... Grabe talaga yong pagmamahal niya sa atin.."
"Filipinos needed to hear these words of nationalism,  love for country, sense of Nationhood, Continuous Faith in Filipinos' greatness and potential in every aspects in life..."
"""When people start spouting lies...dont worry about it, I have the advantage, I know the truth.""
This is epic."
"I was so AMAZE with his wisdom & intelligence he have. This kind of leader is what we need right now. NO HATE, NO POLITICAL PROMISES, NO SELF-BENEFIT BUT ONLY LOVE FOR OUR COUNTRY. 
I REALLY WANT THIS LEADER IN 2022!"
A remarkable 28 minutes of my life. Thank you Toni for giving us THIS.
Thanks Toni! I was hopeless sa mga tatakbo for 2022 halalan but this interview give us a hope for our country and look forward to have a better system in the Philippines - proud kabayan here!! kaway kaway sa mga OFW na di masasayang ang boto!!
"Kung sa tingin ng tao ay may kasalanan si Former President Ferdinand Marcos, let's just bear in mind that 'HINDI KASALANAN NG ANAK ANG NAGING KASALANAN NG KANYANG AMA'. BBM's words struck me most when he said na 'IF WALA KANG KAAWAY, WALA KANG NAGAWA'. Such a very informative interview. Thank you for this Ma'am Toni. "
"Isa sa pinaka hinahangaan ko kay Toni G. Makikita at nararamdaman talaga yung pagiging kristyano niya. Talagang appointed ka ni God because of your vlog with bbm marami saming mga kabataan ang nalinawan sa lahat ng nakasulat sa libro
Keep inspiring us Idol God bless you "
Ito ang tunay na interview my sense at nakakaaliw. You did a good job Toni.

Tatlong beses ko na tong napapanood pero umiiyak prin ako.. laht ng binbtwan mong salita sir tagos‚Ä¶bbm for president.. thank u Ms. Toni
Thats how a real leader should be. Listen how he speaks and answers the questions he is so smart just like his fatherÔ∏è
"Those people who lived during the Martial Law era were the ones in favor of it, yet those who never witnessed it were against it. They lived in hatred and lived a life with a cancel culture. You don't dictate the truth. Bongbong has the right to share his story and speak about his experiences."
"Realtalk: This interview is an eye opener sa kabataang 90's up . Pagkatapos ko manood sa interview na to (3weeks ago) na curious ako bigla sa nangyari noon ano ba talaga ang totoo. Hindi ako mapolitics pero one of the reason nanood ako kc it's Toni who interviewed Sir BBM tsaka yung title talaga nakakaintriga.  Out of curiosity til now still watching on yt sa mga nagawa Ng Marcoses at naway andami palang hindi naisulat sa libro na nakakamanghang ginagawa ni Pres. Marcos para sa Pilipinas. Makatindig balahibo. (Bigla ko na explore vlogs, TikTok ni sir BBM at his fam are so fun and humble nila. Thank you for this mam Toni. Let's spread positivity guys. Praying for better Philippines soon"
Thank you Tony for being courageous Allowing people to hear both sides of the coin  Hatred is non productive We need more positive thoughts Again thank you
"Naalala ko dati bawat pamilya may rasyon na gatas,cornmeal,trigo at sa school may meryenda kami na bhulgor (wheat grains na may halong green peas) masasabi ko na walang bata o pamilya na nagogotom Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"Nakakaiyak naman  tinraydor nating mga pilipino ang tunay na nagmamahal sa atin tas nagpapaniwala lang tayo sa mga demunyong aquino na yan, kinawawa nila si Marcos after lahat ng ginawa niya sa pilipinas, ni ayaw nila iburol ng maayos si Marcos nung namatay grabe dinisplay pa ang katawan niya sa museum, buti nalang nung naging pres na si Duterte, binigyan siya ng maayos na pagbuburol at sobrang salamat kasi nilagay siya sa libingan ng mga bayani ang sakit sa puso grabe kinawawa talaga nila maigi si President Marcos"
"Hahaha, so weird of me, dati rati sweet music pinapakinggan ko habang nagtatatrabaho sa ofis, ngayon or for the past 5 days, paulit ulit kung pinapakinggan ang interview na ito and everytime, para akong napapaluha. BBM‚Äôs recollection of experiences with his father is so powerful. Salamat Toni."
"he is very professional,like his father. as a filipino, i believe that he would make philippines rise again"
"His eyes says it all. Gusto ko siya makita sa Malaca√±ang, watching him speaking at SONA."
"His innate intelligence is actually contagious. Hearing him speak, makes me feel like Im learning a lot "
"Iba yung dating, ang sarap ulit ulitin, I feel the VALUES and LESSONS of MARCOSES. "
"Nung nag trabaho ako sa Taiwan, tinanong ako ng matandang taxi driver kung tiga saan ako at nung sinabi ko na Pilipinas ang sabi ng driver wow Marcos very good president. At nung sa Korea naman ako nag trabaho tinanong na naman ako kung tiga saan ako at sinabi ko Pilipinas, at ang sabi na naman nila Marcos sabay senyas ng naka thumps up at sabi ng good good . Ang galing lang kasi nakaka proud."
Ito ang pinagkait ng mga BIAS MEDIA sa bawat Pilipino na malaman ang totoong story ng mga Marcos. Ang sarap sa ears na marinig ung mga gantong kwento dhl andami kang kapupulotan na aral. Kita mo tlga ung sincerity nya hbng  sya ay nagkwekwento dhl ito ay galing talaga sa knyang puso.  Yong mga gantong kwento ay maituturing tlgang inspirasyon. Ibang klase dn ung words of wisdom nya Very smart talaga.
"That ""last look in the eye""   .. can't help but cry. Namiss ko Dad ko bigla. "
"In this coming election I decided to give chance to Marcos. I think its kind of unfair that we hate the Marcos's because of the things we didn't even witness. I really respect how Marcos family handle the criticism, the situation. Wala ng mananakaw, na ubos na ng past and present administration. Ubos na yung hope ko talaga, wala ng mawawala if i-vo vote ko si Marcos this coming election. Its my right to choose. No hate please."
"Very Sincere The Way He Talk, I Hope And We Hope Mr, BongBong Marcos that if you Win The Presidency this Coming Election Bring Back The Greatness of The Filipino AgainMay God Bless You.."
"Naiyak ako when they talked about Bbm's Father  tao lang din po sila. Pinanood ko hanggang dulo, walang pagkabias ang paginterview ni miss toni, ung istilo nya ng pagtatanong napakahusay. Di mo maihahalintulad sa iba. Napaka galing din ni BBM Sumagot exact to question palagi  yan ang tunay  Mabuhay BBM At Toni G Ô∏è"
"When i was young I remembered busog kaming mga bata sa KLIM , BUN at BULGUR. Dahil sa programa ng Marcos."
I forgot to congratulate Miss Toni Ginzaga for  conducting this interview in a very professional way
"Great interview..such an eye opener about the humanity of the Marcos family in general...the interchange was candid,sincere and respectful..kudos to Toni and BBM.."
"He is so professional and pure in answering the questions given by Ms. Toni. You have my respect, Sir Bongbong. #BBMforPresident"
He is very genuine and you can really tell his love for Filipinos.
"Well said ‚ÄúIf your making your enemies angry it is because you‚Äôre doing a good job, ‚Äú BBM."
"""If you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job."" BBM"
"You can see the sincerety in his eyes, very truthful and honest."
"""If you're making your enemies angry,  you're doing a good job.""

Indeed. The reality "
"im a fan of toni talaga..and this interview of my idol bongbong lalo akong humanga kay toni,,napaka sense lahat ng videos nya.at talino..."
"I am just amazed ho the brilliance of Bongbong‚Äôs mind. Every passage that he eloquently speaks of is felt and the way he thinks (just like his father) makes a realization that Philippines can be the greatest country there is because of its people (tough, but gentle)."
Absolutely Tama Po Yung kwento ni BBM.Tugma sa kwento Ng Lolo at Tito Kong Army at Ng Father ko. 
Naiiyak Ako sa nangyari sa family marcos.marcos forever ako
"Reading comments here made me cry kasi kaming mga born ng 60‚Äôs na witnessed namin what Marcos did to our country he was the best Leader and our country is the richest country in Asia, nirespeto sya ng buong mundo. Sana mabalik uli ang dati kasi kawawa ang future ng pinas lalo n ng mga kabataan. Kabataan namin super saya at normal n namuhay"
No wonder why Miriam chose bongbong as his vice president Ô∏è
"Wow ! 10 Million na pala ang Views nito.. Si BBM lang Malakas ! You're Soaring High like an Eagle !  
.Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"Grabe, sincerity yung naramdaman q, i asked my aunts and parents about marcos time and they said we are the richest country in Asia, cguro kung nagpatuloy lang serbisyu nila, we are equal as America, d na cguro natin mag ibang bansa para kumita ng malaki, i cried because we see hungry Filipinos, Poverty, at kahit anong gawin ngayon, hirap na hirap na bumangon ulit ang pilipinas, I wish BBM to win this battle this time, to prove how worthy mascoses are, sana po gumising na tayong mga Pilipino. Good Luck"
Kitang kita ky BBM..ang taas ng pinagaralan at ganda ng palaki ng ama...npaka cool.....npakasarap panoorin ang history n Marco's.. minsan nakakaluha.pag naiisip mo ang ginawa ng AQUINO. Nakakahinayang sobrang galing at talino ni marcos.wish mabalik ang Marco's...

"The colonization! that it.That is one of the best platform to become a leader.The filipino's deserve better than to be a second class citizens.Future for every filipino is the most important,not ourselves.Ang puso ay talagang para sa bayan at hindi sa sariling kapakanan."

You are our future. "
"Reminds me of my elementary years, the time when all is simple and no worries, basic needs are cheap...andaming libre sa school dati"
"Look at hes body language, papano sya mag salita mag deliver ng words kalmado hindi ""pasikat na nag mamarunong na may alam"" Edukadong edukado, Well this why BBM is the only President this election for me."

"I'm not against Macoses opponents,  but for me,  prng sya lng ung politician na nakita kong natural, unlike the others na puro papogi pogi points at puro pag aangat sa srili ang gingawa. Imagine how Bad they were treated and accused for some issues,  and even elementary students knows Marcos as dictator. Gnyan kalaki ang paninira na gingawa nla,  hnd ko naabutan ang panahon nya pero ung mga old citizens nlng mkpgssbi kung gaano kaunlad ang bansa ntin during his father's term."
"BBM to Ma'am Toni: 
""I Thank you for taking the trouble.""

BBM: ""If you're making your enemies angry, you're doing a good job."""
Nakaka tuwa mag basa ng comment pare pareho ng nasa isip at nararamdaman mga tao dito kasi isipin mo kung sila na ung pinaka masamang pamilya noon bakit may mga kagaya natin na d magawang magalit kasi nga alam natin ung nagawa nila sa bayan buhat ng sila ung naupo napaka daming proyekto stablishment na nagawa  para sa mga tao  nalulungkot nga ako pag nag ba bike ako sa manila nakikita ko yung ccp complex at manila film theatre ba un puro abandoned na napaka ganda sana lugar un porke gawa ng marcos hinayaan ng mga dilawan sana pag upo ni marcos mabuhay nya lahat ng proyekto nahinto bbm for 2022
"Sa lahat ng presidente si Marcos lang ang na meet ko nong pumunta sya sa amin sa Tanauan Batangas sa bahay ng mga Lirio, hinawakan nya pa ulo ko noon. Grade 2 ata ako noon. Ang school namin ay dating palaruan na naging Tanauan cultural center."
"I'd rather give my bote to BBM than Pacquiao, Leni and Yorme. Remember, Mrs. Miriam Defensor Santiago chose him as a vice presidential candidate and said ""PH in good hands if Bongbong takes over"". Iron lady wont give her respect on a person that easy."
People hate dictatorship but they are dictating Toni what her content should beÔ∏è I don't see anything wrong on this interview .
An economist should be our next president to repair our economy. Our economy was one of the greats during Marcos rule
Kaya pala madami nagalit kay Toni kase dahil sa interview na to. Makikilala mo ng husto si BBM w/ch is ayaw na ayaw nila. Npakachill lang ng tanungan napasubscribe tuloy ako. 
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now""

#GOOSEBUMPS"
"""Militarily, we had an advantage, it's just he chose not to fight"". Thanks for this interview. Sarap ulit-ulitin."
"May this be an example to all artists both in entertainment and news to always stand on you what you believe is right. I think Toni has anticipated already what's going to happen next after she publishes this episode. She has known the consequences but still, she has made this vlog possible because she believes it needs to be done. Not everyone has a strong spirit like hers. She is way more professional than anyone in this industry. Godspeed Toni!"
"Pure honesty, walang halong pambobola. We need that kind of leader. Thank you for this ate Toni."
"'I spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I can't hurt them now.'- F. Marcos

A true country's father said."
"made me cry.totoong totoo talaga,tagos sa puso....Godbless toni and BBM"
"Nakakaguilty tuloy. Sa lahat ng nangyari, hindi siya gumanti, instead, tumutulong pa siya. Ang gaganda pa ng mga plataporma niya na hindi nabanggit ng Vice President. Ito talaga yung Filipino pride."
"I was born during Marcos' time, and can attest to it that the Philippines was great, peaceful and abundant. Mahirap at simple lang buhay namin noon, pero napakasaya, napaka tahimik at napakayaman ang mga tao noon. Nakaka proud maging pinoy noon, ngyaon...wala na ang sense of nationhood, kanya kanya, puro sariling bulsa lang iniisip. Philippines was GREAT during marcos' TIME....Philippines was great...."
"'I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now' hits me really hard"
"Toni deserves a praise and a round of applause for showing and interviewing two different sides, for being not bias, and for standing up in the belief that everyone has a story to tell, no matter what past he/she has."
"I am 13 years old, and I am watching this. I really love the history of Philippines, there's so many to learn. Sana marami pang kabataan ang maimpluwensiyahan ng historya ng Pilipinas."
"""I have served my whole life defending Filipinos.  I can't hurt them now.""  President Ferdinand Marcos
  
The Great Leader."
"Watching this for the 2nd time perhaps watching it more than twice. Nakaka taas ng morale nung sinabi niya na ""Pinoys are great"" totoo tlga to especially when you are working in foreign land. Ofw lang nkakarelate nito. :)"
"He is the true definition of a Leader, he speaks with his heart, nakakainspire at nakakaproud maging Filipino "
"""You cannot put a filipino down.""

I literally had goosebumps when I heard it.
Look at how sincere he is as he said those words. How proud he is. He knows how to value our nationality. He knows every quality we possess as filipinos."
I love you toni alam mo ba napasaya mo ang Papa ko na 85 yrs old and my Mom 79 yrs watching this interview with the son of their loved president Ferdinand Marcos. Talagang nkasmile sya from start to end. Napasubscribed ako becoz of this episode. You did the right thing Toni. Youre better than sa ibang totoong journalist na bias. Continue to share stories of wonderdul people.
Hindi ka man po pinalad maging VP pero sisiguraduhin po namin na makukuha mo ang titulo ng President in the year 2022. Count on us po. Mabuhay ka BBM. I trust my lolos and lolas and also my parents. MARCOSES ARE GREAT

Ang ganda naman nito eh...atleast na rinig natin tong history na to kay BBM...
Ito lng ang pinanuod ko hnggng matapos ang interview!.very interesting
People who doesn‚Äôt want a good change and good leadership are those who have personal interests of making money out of illegality. The corrupt officials and greedy businessmen will always oust a good leader to lead a country. They want to be in control of the economy.  This interview is a big threat to those who doesn‚Äôt want peace and prosperity for the nation that they make issues out of this great decent interview.
He's not the best but at least he never uses any means to degrade his opponent.
"But there‚Äôs also this narration:
‚ÄúI shall tell you of William Wallace. Historians from England will say I am a liar, but history is written by those who have hanged heroes‚Ä¶‚Äù
(Braveheart) "
Parang mas dumami pa Ang subscribers ni Ma'am Toni kesa kumonti Salamat sa maiingay na 3% mas makakapagpili ng maayos Ang mga botante sa 2022.
"Telling Toni who she should and shouldn't interview makes you no difference with the ""dictator"" you hate. I humbly ask you, people, to change your perspective. You live in a democratic country; all opinions and actions are considered, as long as it doesn't harm people. So as Toni, she has the right to do this. Let me tell you that Toni have also made an interview from the opposite party, VP Leny Robredo, and no one bashed and made such ridiculous petitions against her. Is that what you think of equality and democracy: a filtered system? It's making me mad how you call yourselves ""wokes"" when you have a very bad perception of a very simple, easy-to-understand, situation like this."
"If Pres. Marcos is not ousted, we should have been same as Singapore right now."
‚ÄúPut your guns down and we‚Äôre not shooting anyone.‚Äù  
"""were not shooting any one"" thats deep. the president just wants to defend the palace. such sadness in that situation. "
"Wow mam Toni , ang galing ng naging vlog Mo po ah it really makes sense .
Thank you ."
"BBM <3
galing ng mga question ni Toni."
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Äù
Kaya pala ganun yung iba."
I would rather choose the so called dictator who made Philippines great in his time through massive building of imfrastracture rather than choosing the so called descent who sold many government properties to private companies just to lessen their liabilities to the people of this great nation.
"Ever since I got into ROTC, I never really fully believe what the books say about them. I mean how can we really believe with only one side of the story? Even the coin we are looking at has a different story. I always have this in my heart na ay may tinago to. Very biased lang kasi. I mean we don't really write a book and call it altogether factual if it's only one side of the story. It's always good to give a benefit of the doubt even if we are confronted with the truth. It's always good to step back for a while and see the whole thing with a different perspective."
this is my third time to visit your vlog with BBM...di nkakasawa panoorin ng paulit ulit
"She can interview whoever she wants. It‚Äôs up to her audience if they want to watch or not. We all have our free will, people should stop hating on others. Ordinary citizens are tired of these whining from yellow people."
"Bat maraming ng ba bash ngyun kay tOni, wla nmn akong makitang politics sa enterview nato!!
.I LOVE U TONI..
GODBLESS U"

This is my first time watching BBM's interview and i'm very overwhelm  the whole time until it ended. Really sincere and truthful. I hope mastop na ang hate sa family ng Marcos 
"""And I think Filipinos deserve better than to be second class citizens...""  BBM  
This statement struck my simple heart.  Long live Philippines regardless of colors and affiliation."
It's like a difficult mission assigned to a son to restore his Father's dignity and fulfill his visions left undone as well to claim his own destiny..  üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠
"From 9 M to 10 M views in just 4 days ! Mr. Marcos has a very strong charisma of his OWN, like no other. Different from some food channel, reality shows, music & celebrity shows, he is the phenomena within his own right compared to none. A title worth to remember."
I am not into politics but this man just earned my respect and surely my vote goes to him.
"""If you hadn't made an enemies, you haven't done anything"" so powerful!"
"Ito ang tunay na mga pinoy! Very humble and professional.    
 She asked him respectfully and he answered her truthfully."

"Toni is a blessing to us Filipinos in giving us authentic, unbiased and heartfelt interviews. This interview actually catapulted her to be the best vlogger there is in our present time. And with this short interview I got the clear message of Bongbong's intention to run for the presidency. Good job to you both!"
"""i think that Filipinos deserve better than to be second class citizens"" that hits me hard.."
"Regards to Mam Toni Gonzaga, napaka ganda po ng inyong interview kay Sir BBM, and for BBM Sir, Marami na pong nag hihintay sa iyong  pamumuno  Godbless po sainyo."
"Isa na siguro sya sa magiging dahilan na masasabi nating ""Pinoy Ako"". That  sincerity in his eyes

‚ÄúFilipinos deserve better than to be second class citizens.‚Äù  Well said sir
PAG NAGING PRESIDENTE SI BBM LULUHOD AKO SA GITNANG SIMBAHAN HABANG NAG DADASAL NA NAG PAPASALAMAT SA PANGINOON üáµüá≠ babalikan ko tong comment ko na ito
Hindi ako ipinanganak noong rehimeng Marcos pero makikita mo SA Mata ni. BBM  sincerity to help  at Filipinos at ang ibangon muli ang Dignidad Ng mga Pinoy....Ang maging Tiger of Asia not just in Asia but around the world just like before....I can't stop myself crying while watching this interview and I don't know why
"As kabataan, Dapat talaga pagaralan muna natin at mag siyasat muna tayo bago bumoto. Hindi yung kung sino lang ang trending, Yun na ang iboboto. Almost a month ko na pinapanood at inaaral ang kwento ng mga marcos. And with this video, My vote is for marcos!!Ô∏è Stand firm BBM!"
Grabi! Bukas na bukas ang puso nya katulad ng kanyang ama. Naiyak ako na pinanuod ito. Thank you toni for this interview. Really really thank you.
"""Pinoy are the best""...  that made me smile and proud to be Pinoy while working here in a foreign land... thank you BBM..."
"Ginamit ni Lord God si Toni para maging instrument na makilala ng Filipinos si sir BBM. Kung hindi dahil dito, hindi magiging trending ang pangalan ni sir Bong Bong at hindi magiging curious yung mga taong hindi siya kilala. Sure itong interview na ito, merong reason kung bakit nangyari  Thank you Toni for doing your purpose. "
Whenever he open his mouth and spout some words I feel the sincerity in his words. He's a very humble and genuine person and I can  feel how love and proud he was to his late father .
"I admire toni a lot, ang professional nya lang talaga sa lahat ng interview nya pero eto ung pinaka paborito ko napapaiyak ako habang na nonoodÔ∏è salamat toni dahil sayo narinig na namin lahat nang hinanain at kabutihan ng mga Marcos Ô∏è"
"Toni is always unbiased on her interviews, love her! She's meant to interview BBM to enlighten alot of people. Andaming nagising dahil narin sa interview nato. Yung mga tahimik lang nagka courage. Yung mga walang pakialam nagain ang interest. Ofcourse kudos sa mga solid BBM who stayed from the very beginning until now."
"BBM deserves to be the next President of the Philippines,just like his father,full of wisdom.üáµüá≠"
Grabe ang galing ni Tony dito napaka professional. Unbiased at hindi bastos
"""Pilipinos deserve better then to be treated as a second class citizens""-BBM   ""I wish we were never colonized""-BBMüáµüá≠ a true Patriotic and Nationalist Pilipino"
"One thing is for sure, Tony G‚Äôs name will be added to Philippine history that once upon a time when people are blinded there is a sincere woman who opens our eyes not to be one-sided; there are always two sides of the story. Thanks to Tony G. Angas ng mga Marcos, very humble pa rin sa kabila ng Lahat. Salute!"
Tinapos ko tong clip grabe na energized yung diwa ko. Na boost yung confidence ko na sabihing proud filipino ako. Ô∏è
"""Helping as more people as u can""

"You are doing a great job toni, giving a voice for everybody. Being neutral  in all aspects and in any way.  We always look forward and cannot even guess who will be your next guest to be interviewed. Galing ng  Toni talks! "
"The interview went well.  Politely, questions were answered smart, composed and with no drama.  This is a mere light conversation.  Toni Gonzaga handled it well, without pinpointing, accusing and pulling down the ""Marcos"" history. On the other hand, BBM answered the question direct to the point, without shaming or blaming others....
Simply, BBM wants to unite the nation again, he wants the Philippines great again and back to our own nationhood.  No body can answer the way BBM did in this interview. I commend you BBM and Toni."
"This is a brilliant interview. Toni is a brilliant interviewer and BBM is an intelligent & charismatic subject. Both are well spoken, Toni made it look easy to segue from one subject to the next. This is not intended to be a hard hitting political take down piece. The interview was structured well by starting from when he was a child until his father‚Äôs death then segued into his vision for the future. She‚Äôs so good, the interview flowed seamlessly. His father‚Äôs ‚Äòsins‚Äô are not his sins. This is an interview about a son who loved his father. Who are we to judge? Great job Toni. Brilliant. "
My dear Filipinos! Please give him a chance to prove them wrong! Please he is the only hope left of our country. He will make things better and continue the legacy of our country to be GREAT again.

"He speaks from the heart, randam na ramdam mo talaga ang sinceridad nya. Saludo po ako sa inyo BBM and for Toni, thank you for sharing this interview. God bless you!"
"He is the Vice President of the late former Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago. With such intelligence and love for country, she chose BBM to be her Vice President for she knows his capabilities and potential. Give BBM a chance to help the Philippines. 

To the young ones, let us weigh things and think wisely. Vote wisely for our future depends on how we think. GOD BLESS THE PHILIPPINES! üáµüá≠"
"Ferdinand Marcos. The President who once made the country known as The Tiger of Asia, more progressive than Singapore  during his reign, respected by other countries, had many infrastractures where many of us are benefiting until now, who doesn‚Äôt read his speech and never boast on his achievements. 
Loyal Marcos until now."
"I don't know why but this interview just made me cry. That ""final look"" that BBM was talking about really impacted me. You can see a man who genuinely talks about how great of a father and leader his dad was. Miss Toni really did it well. Her questions and Sir Bong's responses are very relevant and straightforward. Kudos!"
"I watched this interview na pampaantok sana. Hindi tuloy ako nakatulog sa sobrang paghanga. Great job, Toni. #BBM2022"
"""I have spent my whole life defending the Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down. We are not hurting anyone"" "
"The word "" I have spent my whole life defending Filipino, I cannot hurt them now put your guns down were not hurting anyone""
That word hits diff. on my opinion its a heroic note"
"This interview, is so indepth, both of them are so relax, no rush and no pretentions. You can sense the nationalism of this guy, as a swing voter, its a game changer for me"
"BBM is compose and he speaks humbly. Very compose and tactful, aside from smart politician. Born with a heart for public service. What struck me is his nationhood idealogy. Time to be proud as Filipino again. Vote wisely!Praying for Philippines. BBM is the last card bringing up the good works of FEM. BBM for 2020 President! Thank you Jesus"
"We can see Toni Gained more and more Subscribers and millions of views!!! It shows that there are more than Brainies now than the 3% of idiots!!! 
We're behind people that are supporters for the better of a Country!!! 
Keep up the Good Work Toni and Direktor PAULsoriano!!! More Power to this POWER COUPLE "

I believe that this interview will be a starting point to make this nation great again.
this is the kind of content that Filipino needs. Fair interview. Thank you for this Toni G.
"My lolo was caught drunk during marshall law. He was put into jail, and was removed from service as a police man. But if you ask him now kung sino ang best president of all time, his never changing answer ""si Marcos""."
"Unassuming, humble and so down to earth in every sense of the word in more ways than one 
Hindi maitago ang inherent goodness ni BBM as a person 
His values are deep-rooted nasa kaibuturan ng kanyang pagkatao
It's something that parents could pass on to their children "
"At the last moment of his power, all he wanted was the safety of the people. Best President we ever had that time...Thank you President Marcos.
Bring back the legacy..BBM for president 2022."
Enjoyed this interview a lot!!  Ilang beses ko na pinanood.  naiiyak parin ako... Thanks Toni G!
"I was crying not about politics, the way he follow his dad and the way he doesn‚Äôt understand why people hate his dad as young as 6. He have everything and his devotion to Filipinos is so great that until the very last he choose to protect what he have been protecting all his lifetime. It‚Äôs so sad to hear that last look you can see from your loved one passing away will be in him forever."
This is one of the best interview by miss Tony G. Naalala ko pa sabi ng mga parents ko ibang iba nung panahon ni Marcos. Walang maraming mahirap. At isa sa pinakamayamang bansa ang Pilipinas. Dahil ang piso nuong araw ay mahalaga marami kana mabibili pero ngayon san na aabot ang piso mo. At walang maraming nangingibang bansa nuon dahil mayaman ang Pilipinas nuong panahon ni Marcos.
"I can feel his sincerity the way he answer the questions, very soft spoken and intelligent I believe in you pooo! We will support you til' the end! #BBM"
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job.‚Äù  

I‚Äôm speechless. This is worth watching. I have learned a lottttt. BBM for 2022. YOU  ARE PROLLY THE MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENT. Ô∏è‚Äç"
"This is the best interview ever conducted 
The interviewer was able to dig into the stories past and are in the deep recesses of our minds
This actually is a reawakening of hearts which has long been asleep for quite sometime and it really feels so so good"
"1993 ako and watching this interview makes me goosebumps grabe, I remember nung elementary and HS yung libro  ng Araling Panlipunan subject,  puro Aquino lang mabubuti..  !  

 I just love BBM and Toni G.."
One of the most impactful interviews of BBM..galing ni Celestine..i wasn't surprised when some quarters were upset about this interview..so authentic and real..no filter..vlogging is better than interviews on national tv..
Grabe napaka galing magsalita ni BBM our future pres 
"I remember those times when my lolo and lola are still alive, lagi nilang pinagtatanggol sakin ang mga Marcos. I always hated our late President Ferdinand Marcos because that's what they taught us at school. Lagi akong nakikipagtalo sa mga grandparents ko noon one time nasabihan ako ng lola ko ""Wag mo akong turuan na parang nabuhay ka ng mga panahon ni Marcos, kami ang nakakita, kami ang nakasaksi"" then little by little I was enlightened and those learnings that I thought was true, it was all manipulated by those who won after Marcos. Grabe! Nung mga time na yun I felt like my whole childhood was a lie, I felt like I was cheated. But now, not anymore. Now I fully understand what my parents and grandparents are trying to tell me. Ngayon ang pangarap ko nalang maranasan din ang klase ng pamumuno na pinagmamalaki ng mga magulang at lolo't lola ko."
Ganda ng interview and I'm definitely rooting for BBM this coming election.
"Sa lahat po ng bbm supporters na tulad ko...sana po ikampanya natin cya para lalong dumami tayo...in a small  way thing we do pero kapag pinagsama-sama  malaki ang impact at matutulungan natin si sir bbm..ikampanya natin cya sa lahat ng ating kakilala,kaibigan,at sa lahat...God bless us all po..."
"My mom told me that she‚Äôs still young at that time when his father Ferdinand Marcos reigned as a president and my grandparents told us that when he is the president we are a rich country and they are living well my grandfather  has a good job they are living well, his time was the time where everything‚Äôs ok , and Philippines is one of the most popular country in Asia. Wish I could vote now but since I‚Äôm still young what I could do is pray for Mr. Bongbong Marcos if it is God‚Äôs plan for him he will be the next president and help our country regain it‚Äôs shine as Asia‚Äôs pearl of the South:)"
"""i have spent my whole life depending Filipinos."" I cannot hurt them now. ""- Ferdinand Marcos to Bongbong (nakakaiyak po ito)"

Grabe nakaka proud yung sinabi ni BBM we are pinoy we‚Äôre the BEST tlaga inaangat nya mga pilipino. Ô∏èYou should be the next president idol. Happy birthday BBM
"Dahil dito sa interview na to ...namulat ako SA katutuhanan, salamat po SA social media andami Kong nalalaman sa nangyayari talaga noong kapanahunan Ng kanyang amangayon alam ko na Kong Sino ang karapat dapat na iboto sa darating na eleksiyon2022,..BBM for president no.1 po SA aming mga puso"
I can see an ordinary person not a politician. I can see his sincerity. BBM all the way for 2022
Can we talk about Toni's questions? Hindi Tayo makakakuha Ng magandang sagot Mula Kay BBM  Kung Hindi magaganda Ang Tanong ni Toni. Ang galing! And also the sincerity of BBM  nakakaiyak
"Very tear jerking video. You can feel the sincerity in everything he says.

I loved how Toni did her interview. She took it in a different light. It was very casual but it was more insightful unlike the mainstream media who tries to monopolize the audience with their own narrative."
I don't see bad in this interview... There's no bias as well... Toni did a good questions and BBM answers it with sincerity. The people who will hate it are people who are bitter. They're the people who are toxic and live their lives in grudges. Appreciate you a lot Toni and BBM.
"Hirap naman panoorin nito while you‚Äôre in a public place. There are heavy, very meaningful moments where you can look into the lives of the father and the son. "

"He is the best candidate for the presidency. Nakakabilib, ang talino at maraming good qualities of a leader. "
"This what we called, RESPECT! 
Dapat ganito lahat yung mga tao sa pag iinterview. Di tulad ng iba pag nag interview feeling magaling bastos naman"
"the way how he tell the story he amazed me. Hearing his side you feel its genuinely coming from his heart. Fact that everyone of us fools by the history. I agree everytime i asked my grandmother how was the marcos presidency? She was starring at me seriously! He was great and Philippines are number 1 in terms of exporting. Our country are rich in all form. Minerals, Skilled workers in short all the resources we already had. If i could bring back to that year i will choose him as my president. quoted See that how marcos did back in the century. I hope this time every Filipino would choose the visionary type of a leader and if BBM will run as president I will vote for him. The quality of a real leader i saw from him he was mold by his father experiences he had a point that you can never please anybody to like you. Toni thank you for sharing this kind of good content. Weve learned so much i hope for the success of your journey. Godbless"
"Remember when Mrs. Imelda Marcos would join traveling with her husband in any country, she would always wear her Filipi√±ana to show how she's proud of being Filipino, not just that she would also bring OPM songs to the world with some  Musician/Bands."
Let's give him a chance. He has knowledge more than anyone. He learned from the best leader no other than - - Ferdinand Marcos.
"Tears . "" I am defending filipinos my whole life i cannot hurt them now"""
"Im not into politics but after watching this. Im now into someone who's mindset is on the nationhood, who has the striaght vision for the Filipinos. Someone who is knowledgeable to what the country truly needs. He's ryt. Haters gonna hate. As long as you know that you who have the spirit of leading the people towards success. Fight for it. Manifesting the best to ALL FILIPINOS... VOTE FOR THE BETTER FUTURE..."
"It has been over 30 years of journey on finding truth about our country‚Äôs downfall and finally, filipinos are now woke. We thank Pdu30 for waking us all up and building a new foundation for the future generations. In all the 2022 Presidential candidates only BBM has the capacity to sustain and continue the changes that we have been experienced. All i can see from him is his Knowledge, Principles, Leadership and Compassion towards his people. The future looks bright with BBM, let‚Äôs help him bring the Philippines back to the world stage.

Upon watching this, nabuhayan ako ng pag-asa na meron pang pagbabago dahil may naniniwala sa atin. Naniniwala siya na kaya natin, naniniwala siya na iba tayo, basta naniniwala siya that we can be great as long as we are supported and unified Ô∏è"
Toni just did a great job. Bongbong is really a humble person.
Ang sarap sa puso na sa wakas narinig na natin si BBM. Thank you Ms. Toni for being brave dahil sa ngayon madami ka ng haters dahil dito but haters gonna hate so be it!
"Marcos is the hero. Pls filipino people, this man has the heart for all people in the Philippines please look his goal at vision. He will go this country to the greatest. I promise that."
"So happy for this interview. This is my third time watching it. Honestly, last 2016, I felt so sad when BBM was not able to make it as our VP. You always have our support Sir. We will support you and praying that you would be our next president. I can really see the sincerity and the pure heart that wants to serve the country."
BBM is a wise man and have a vision  to our country. His only intention is make the Philippines sustainable and I admired him to his brilliant idea of Windmill energy which is very safe to our environment. We are always here to support you sir bongbong and tatay digong as well. Godbless us all and to our country :))
"Iba pag totoong kwento at talagang nangyare kahit nanunuod ka lang ramdam mo, Thank you Ms. TONI kudos! Sarap pakinggang ang conversation nakakabitin."

"Amazing! Like his father, he is visionary.. The Philippines needs a strong leadership. He is the absolute perfect fit! Mabuhay po kayo Sir bong. And miss Tony idol kita. Galing mo mag interview..."
I declare him as the next PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES!!!!  GOD BLESS YOU SIR BONGBONG....From UAE with love

Tamang sinulatan ko si Marcos ng magandang Editorial Article nung highschool ako 
This will be the most viewed vlog of Ms. Toni Gonzaga! Trust me.
I was'nt born in marcos era..but according to the history and the life story of my oldies..if i am to choose which president is the best to handle the phillipines it will be marcos..because of how great the phillipppines was..and that is something i am looking forward if one of his fruit govern the country.kung anong puno syang bunga
"This is considered very excellent interview, very realistic and full of wisdom."
"""If you're making your enemies angry, You're doing good job."" Thats what smart people do."
"Just sharing.  I started being curious about the late Marcos  when I started working here in Manila . Probably  about 3x a week (esp. during the  workweek ,bec.  usually I ride a taxi when it's difficult to take the train or bus), I'll share this random conversation with manong taxi driver and from my observation, they seem to always  mention how ""life"" was easier  or ""better"" during the Marcos regime. Of course, I am living in the era where the reality is ""Filipinos hated the outcome of the Martial Law"" or should I say the ""Martial law"" so I couldn't really comment on what was being said that time  by the taxi driver. But you know, come to think of it, these taxi drivers must have gone through or have seen a lot to say such things. So since then, I've started to watch the late Marcos videos, speeches ( well, hindi ko naman napanood pa lahat ) .. and read few articles about him and I realized, there are good things that happened to our country during his time that wasn't written on our elementary or high school books ( or pwede din kasi sa school lang namin yun ) .. So since then, I try to keep an open mind,  everything that's written or reported these days are 100% inaccurate.  I so do wish, every concerned citizen will think the same and refrain from making snap judgements just because the tree bore a yellow or a red fruit.  Thank you po Ms. Toni for having a balance platform. God Bless you!"
"Sir BBM is a very soft spoken kind of man....his very happy talking about his father a true love for a man in his father who everyone thinks is a ""DICTATOR""..I love ms. Toni's non bias questions..."
We all deserves this kind of president after Pres. duterte 
The best interview I've ever watched..nabigyan ng pagkakataon na ma express ang nararamdamn
The way he spoke..is such a smart leader like his father..
"After watching the interviews, sana marami ang nakaobserve kung sino ang deserving manalo, and that is BBM! 

Share ko lang based on my experience, i'm a student at PUP and sobrang toxic sa university na yun. Kahit walang connection sa subject at lesson, ang tinuturo ng mga prof namin ay tungkol sa martial law at anti-marcos. Kapag pumalag ka sa mga sinabi nila na against kay marcos, bagsak ka kaya shut up na lang kami. Ang daming kabataan ang na-brain wash ng mga state universities at private kasi simula elementary palang sila ay tinuturuan na sila ng mga mali. Kaya tama yung sinabi ni BBM na lies become truth. Kaya kapag nanalo siya napresident sana mabago ang mga nakalagay sa libro at maling tinuturo na masama ang marcos. My parents and relatives mismo kinikwento samin kung gaano kaganda dito sa pilipinas noong panahon ni Marcos kasi naexperience nila at nasira lang dahil sa mga Aquino at mga dilawan."
"""I have spent my whole life defending the Pilipinos, I cannot hurt them now."""
He speaks intelligence. All boxes checked! Ô∏è
"‚ÄúThat last look‚Äù

is Ferdinand Marcos Sr. telling to his son to continue his legacy."
Grabe dko pa natatapos pinapanood ko pero naiiyak nako. Buti nalang may gantong interview mas nakikila ko si president marcos at si BBM. Sana tlaga si BBM ang manalo.
Gusto ko sya maging president not because of he is a Marcos son but I believe him pero natatakot lang ako na baka dayain nman SYA sa butohan I believe to all pilipino people we will win BBM to become a President of the Phillipines I vote for him
"I will always remember what our history teacher said, ""That history (books) are written by who's in power."" , and our family's elderlies words, Marcos era was way better than his successors."
"i‚Äôve been supporting Marcoses since i heard the truth, the way he speaks and what he did specifically for ilocos really reflects his father in him. Marcoses had been great leaders to us and we all know he can lead our country."
I cannot wait to see this man be the next president of the Philippines. BBM for the President!
I like how BBM talk. You will feel that he is so intelligent. He talks about solutions and how to make our country great again. This is what a President should be. Please vote wisely. Remember the President will represent our whole country.
"Kahit sobrang daming paninira, never silang nagsabi ng masama laban sa mga kalaban nila. They stayed quiet and humble. Kahit sa interview na to. Samantalang yung kabila pag ininterview puro na lang paninira at pagbubuhat ng sarili nilang bangko. Dun palang makikita mo na kung anong klase silang tao. Usually yung mga taong humble, they are so calm kasi alam nila yung truth. And those people na naninira, they are so desperate to look like they are the innocent ones so they pretend to deceive people. "
"Yes! Bbm just announced that he will be running for President. Filipinos will suppprt you, Sir. We believe in you."
Bongbong Marcos is such a humble guy! May he be the next President of the Philippines amen!
He cried when Toni asked about his father's death. Toni knows how to bring out emotions regarding certain topics. You can feel the candidate's knowledge in solving our country's situation.
"That is why Ferdinand Marcos was my favourite president, I hope that Sir bong bong Marcos is just like hes father were counting on you sir.Ô∏è
And Im finally votingÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
The pain of losing a parent. No amount of time can heal the pain. You just learn how to live with the pain.
The best interview i've ever watched.. Ang galing.
"Next time he gets an interview with Toni, he's already the President."

"I still remember my father told me during pres Marcos about curfew... Basta sumunod ka sa batas hindi ka mapapasama.. May isang gabi naabutan sila ng curfew at nakainom sila.. Natural hinuli sila pero hindi sila pumalag, parang kinulong sila sa sasakyan Yun diko Alam tawag dun wala naman ginawa sa kanila kundi Para mawala Lang ang amats Nila at pinakawalan din. Dito sa lugar namin naalala ko panun Bata ako 1980's  nakasanayan na pagpumatak ng 7am sisirena ang plaza at lahat titigil maski mga sasakyan at mga naglalakad Para pa tugtugin ang Pambansang Awit.. Ganun ka disiplinado noon.. Ah sayang  sana Pala nagpa kwento pa ako noon....."
The way he talks is like his father i watch PFM previous interviews.. when talking about life he answers the most honest and smart answer no politics.. no wonder he is PFM son..
"Wooaahhh!!! nakakaiyak! ThankYouSoMuchAlmightyGodLordJesus!

"their VISION for the Philippines is the most important thing that the other competitors doesn't have. And I think BBM have that all the time. Naghahanap kayo ng mga nagawa nya and natatawa ang mga anti-Marcos kasi di makapag bigay ng mga nagawa or contribution si BBM sa bansa, pero tingnan nyo nman naging experiences nya, sa murang edad pa lang..mulat na sya sa realidad na nangyayari sa palasyo at politika. Marami syang natutuhan hindi lang sa pag-aaral pati sa leadership na meron ang tatay nya. Hindi tulad ni Fuchsia pink na nabyuda lang nagka ambisyon nang maging pangulo. Mula noon hanggang ngayon walang pinagbago sa plataporma nya kundi puro tungkol sa pagiging ina ng bansa at pagtulong sa mahihirap, paano nman yung mga paraan mo para matulungan sila?? Anong mga icocontribute mo para makatulong sa kanila at mawala ang kahirapan sa bansa?? Napaka-Vague ng sinasabi nyang para lang makatulong sa mahihirap, sa tingin mo pagtulong lang ba sa mahihirap ang solusyon sa pag-unlad ng bansa??"

This is one of the most HEARTFELT interviews I have ever watched. Very sincere and no sugar coating just REAL. I just found myself teary eyed while watching the entire video. GOODJOB TONI and SALUTE Mr. BONG BONG MARCOS! Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
Kahit ilang beses mapanood. It''s like a breath of fresh air. Can't help to watch many times the next President of the Republic of the Philippines üáµüá≠

"Totoo nga ang kwento ng lolo,lola,nanay at tatay ko  Iba talaga ang mga marcos sana magtulungan tayong lahat upang manalo ang BBM "
"I only had the chance to watch this interview now. And I can‚Äôt help myself from crying when he was asked about his dad‚Äôs last word to him. This segment is just so real. You could see the sincerity of his words. The flow of his thoughts is so clear. Very intelligent and humble man. I wish him well and luck! I see him being the next President of the Philippines! God bless you, Sir Bongbong!Ô∏è"
Matapos ko marining ito. My vote is for BBM. Nafeel ko yung sincerity niya. He's full of knowledge and wisdom. Ô∏è
"3.9M views, this is how filipino people loves Marcos, an eye opener to others. Thanks Ms Toni"
"His Father almost perfected the Law Bar Exam and who can make long speeches local and overseas with no papers to read complete with dates, time, names  and all details including figures of numbers. Memorized them all.. A real brilliant mind. ."

"honestly what i saw in this interview is not the senator bong marcos, but the son who talked so much with  love and adored and respect his father so much. a son who is painfully missing his dad. this interview is one of the most genuine one."
"""Pinoys are the best"" I can just cry. We do need to bring back nationhood and our own identity. Ang sarap ng pakiramdan na marinig na mayroong tao na nagtitiwala sa kakayahan natin,hindi yung pangako ng pangako lang. I am not a political person, but I would love to see Philippines on top,not only economically but also on their arts (bring back the love for OPM),skills,and nationhood. Nakakaproud dito sa abroad na magkikita mga pinoy,kahit pagod sa trabaho, makikita mo na dahil sa pamilya ,nagsisikap..nakikilala ang quality of work and talent..at nagtutulungan..sana ganto sa buong pinas,hindi yung kung kailan nasa abroad na,saka lang makikita ang kapatiran.. I can't vote,but I will hope that Marcos can continue serving and Philippines will one day go back on top"

"My grandmother used to tell us, in the 1970s the crime and poverty rate is so low and she said: ""life is so simple yet people never go hungry."" The greatest era of the Philippines is during the reign of your father. God bless you, truth always prevail."
"Omg!  This is the video Toni was heavily bashed against by the triggered!?!?  Ang ganda ng interview.  Nasaan ang bias dito!?!?  Good job,  Toni!"
"naluha ako nung nakita kong naluluha si BBM 
my first vote is for u."
"I asked my lolo, and one thing he said about marcos, time, ""even we are farmers that time, we don't starve we have enough, because we export rice with the help of the government"""
"Toni:"" Thank you very Much.""
BBM: "" No, I Thank you for taking the trouble.""

Start palang ng interview talaga parang alam na ni BBM na maraming magrereact/ mangbabash kay Toni."
"Maybe it's time for the MARCOS to rule again in the Philippines , maybe during his time we will gain again the fame of the Philippines we have during their time"
Yung lolo laging na remember ang kabutihan ni pres.marcos at ang ma remember ko yung nutri ban soya milk lebre..sinira lng talaga ng mga aquino..ang lahat..pro now gising na lahat Godbless BBM OFW ALL OUT SUPPORT WITH YOU..
"Sino po andito after ng declaration ni BBM for president ng Pilipinas? 
#BBMlangsakalam
#BBMforPRESIDENT2022"
Ako lang ba na after kung napanood ang vlog na ito ay nalaman ko rin na may vlog din pala si BBM . Ang ganda po ng mga content ng vlog
Thanks Toni for getting into this idea of interviewing BBM.
"""I thank you for taking the trouble"" BBM already knew before Toni interview him that she will have a a lot of bashers from the other parties "
IBA TALAGA SI TONI GONZAGA !! ISINILANG TALAGA SYA BILANG JOURNALIST ! napakahusay mag tanong ! At hindi Bias Di tulad ng mga journalist sa ABS-CBN sa TV PATROL etc. Basta MARCOS ang usapan alam na
BBM FOR PRESIDENT ILALABAN KA NAMIN SIR THIS IS YOUR TIME NA PO
He didnt hesitate to answer every time Toni questioning him.
"""If you're speaking, learn it. Do not read it."""

Grabe #1 trending nice
"naaalala ko noon may natatanggap kami na rasyon may trigo saka yung paborito ko na gatas,grabe walang guton na pamilya talaga noon maliit pa ako nun pero natatandaan ko"
This is an interview on love of a son for his father. This isn't a documentary on martial law. Bakit galit na galit kayo?
Election is coming and I‚Äôm trying search for more information about the people who‚Äôs going to run for president in 2022. I just don‚Äôt want to base on my own knowledge about someone. I still want to prove if it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been against Duterte kase naman hindi siya nakikinig at hindi pa agad binan yung travel especially nung time na mag spread na yung covid pero may mga gusto parin akong nagawa niya. Pati sa Marcoses ang dami kong narinig na masasama at pinaniwalaan ko yon hanggang sa yon nalang yung katotohanan na alam ko. These past few I‚Äôve been hearing about people and reading some comments bashing Toni kase dahil sa interview. Fan parin ako ni Toni kahit pa iba yung i-support niya sa sinu-support ko. Kaya ganun nalang tingin ko sa mga tao na nagagalit kase si Toni in favor kay Bong Bong Marcos and I think that‚Äôs fine because we have the freedom of speech and expression so we don‚Äôt have the right to tell someone on what to do. Everyone has the right to choose. Then I‚Äôm watching some foreigners especially korean who‚Äôs making fun of Filipinos dahil accent or educational system. Paano naman idi-discriminate eh kahit tayo pinagtatawanan natin sarili nating accent at baliw na baliw sa kpop. Pero naisip ko at some point may katotohanan naman sa sinasabi nila. About sa economy natin pati bilihin. Kaya naisip ko na panoorin tong interview ni Toni kay BBM. I have a lot of realizations. I‚Äôm thinking of voting him as a president in 2022 but I will still continue to search for more information pa.
They are scared that this side of the history is revealed.
"""If you haven't made any enemies, you haven't done anything"" This is also powerful. I will definitely vote and campaign for Sir Bong if he'll run for presidency. I asked my grandmother this morning about her experiences on Marcos' leadership. She told me that there were really a lot of 'chismis' about them being 'kurakot' but she strongly explained how rich the country was back then. There's a lot of projects like the schools, hospitals, roads, bridges and other essential establishments - all for the Filipino people "
"This is the first time na nanuod ako ng vlog ni Toni. I admit, naiyak ako sa part na sinabi ni BBM na tumingin pa sa kanya si Apo Marcos bago namatay Very decent man, wala kang maririnig na paninira sa mga taong naninira sa kanila. Thanks Toni for being FAIR"
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I can't hurt them now.""
-Ferdinand E. Marcos"
"I love how the comments are full of positivity and admiration for this man. When people are asking me, why BBM? 
Why not? Just watching this interview, I can see and feel his sincerity. Wala kang maririnig na kahit anong atake para sa kabilang partido na puro hate ang binabato sa kanya. Ipanalo sana natin si BBM sa 2022, ang panalo nya ay panalo din nating mga Pilipino."
"untold stories I can‚Äôt resist to watch multiple times
respect to both BBM & Toni"
His being proud as a Filipino melts my heart. Nakakaproud maging pinoy!
"I work as a physical therapist and have handled so many elderly and everytime I asked about how Marcos regime, all they have to say was the Philippines are better during those time compared to the era's after President Marcos. Media has put so much hatred in the hearts of Filipinos, why not just spread love and happiness and spoke for the truth more power Ms. Toni GonzagaÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"While watching this video, I felt emotional, I cried in fact, the memory of my childhood came back, how me and my siblings survived school without any cents in the pocket, we still had something to eat thanks to free food like nutriban, milk and cocojam from the government. Those were the days when all my playmates, siblings, were happily singing ""Bagong Lipunan"" in school and even while playing  I felt blessed because I experienced the government of President FEM."
Toni was so effective. She was able to extract the other side of the Marcos story which was hidden for so long. I like BBM's vision on bringing back Filipino nationhood! What an inspiration! All the best BBM! 
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos.  I cannot hurt them now.  Put your guns down, we're not shooting anyone.""  That speaks volume."
""" I've spent my whole life defending filipinos, i cannot hurt them now""- marcos

I literally cried when i heard this.."
He is the kind of leader that we need to unify our country. So intelligent yet humble.
"‚Äúwow just wow‚Äù  thank you toni for this interview with BBM. teary eyed while watching ‚Äú i‚Äôve fought my whole life for Filipinos, will not hurting them‚Äù so touching Marcos parin may malasakit , makabayan at may puso sa ating mga Pilipino."
"BAGONG LIPUNAN a patriotic song that we are always sang during my elementary school,life was  so  easy those days. and Marcos is a real servant of Filipinos willing to extend help."

"I cried watching this. 8 years ago, I was talking to my female friend in Australia, then out of nowhere, her sister interrupted us asking where I am from and I said, I'm from the Philippines, and she replied, MARCOS is the Best President in the Philippines. During his time, your country was one of the richest countries in the world. Her comments made me speechless."
A man who is sharing his childhood memories. How kind and loving his father was and how he see his father as a man whom he is proud of.
"This interview was neutral yet intellectual. I admire how BBM openly and professionally handles all the lies thrown against him, to his family, and especially to his father.
As a young adult, I grew up believing that Marcos made the lives of the Filipinos hard because of Martial Law, but upon listening to the testimonies of the ones who first handedly experienced the Marcos Regime and through research, my perception turned to 180¬∞.  "
Sana Mam tony wag mo sirain ang tiwala naming mga Pilipino. Sobrang proud ako sayo. noon pa man alam ko na napakalinis ng puso mo. thank you for this wonderful interview with Mr. Bongbong.Ô∏èBBM po ang presidente ko. üáµüá≠Ô∏è
"Very pure and natural. I feel that he‚Äôs actually saying what‚Äôs in his heart. No flowering words, just the truth. Grabe out of nowhere, napaiyak nalang talaga ako kasi since my elementary days, puro kasamaan nya yung tinatanim ng turo ng libro sa isip ko.I remember my english/history teacher who was once against the lesson in the book that contains disproved issues and criticisms about FEM, she just told us, ‚ÄúACTUALLY NAABUTAN KONG NAGING PRESIDENTE SI FEM, AND ISA LANG MASASABI KO, HE WAS A GREAT LEADER, OUR ECONOMY WAS GREAT AND ALL THE FILIPINOS WERE DISCIPLINED.‚Äù And because of that, curiosity starts to grow in my head. But now, I realized that truths just came out naturally. Respect my comment guys. NO HATE NA SANA. JUST STOP THE HATE NALANG AND RESPECT EACH OTHERS OPINION. Basta ako, I should pick a leader who has the quality of being a ‚ÄúPATRIOTIC‚Äù not a SELF-CENTERED one."
"This is what we are looking, a true leader. Di dinadaan sa panaginip ang istorya. Mabuhay po kayo President !!!!!! God will give a next good President!!!! Mabuhay!!!!!"
Buti nalang napanood ko to!!!mas lalo ako napahanga sa mga MarcosesGod bless u
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos."" 
""I cannot hurt them now."""
"I can't believe I bashed this person til before I watch this. I saw myself drown from lies. Hopefully it is not too late for my change of heart. Thank you Toni, as a 19 years old registered voter, you opened up my eyes and heart."
"The best interview of Bongbong Marcos, this is some kind of wake up calls for some Filipinos,FOREVER MARCOS"
"""I HAVE DONE SO MANY SINNED BUT STEALING MONEY FROM THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT ONE OF THEM""
-Ferdinand Marcos"
"Haters gonna hate, controversial na kung controversial, but for me, this interview is one of the most bona fide interviews ever done in social media..... This just purely showcase and features Mr. BongBong's life experiences, adversities and triumph, sorrows and joys,  how his uprbinging was, educational background, his lifestyle, his father's legacy, downfall and death, what he went through his teeneage years and adulthood and cope with those things, how his parents became phenomanal factors to hone and equip him as what he is the exact type of man right now."
"This talk is a revelation... 
Thanks to the people behind setting up this episode & mostly to you Toni."
"I may not be patriotic, but we should be grateful to that ""One man"" who defended the Philippines from the influence and cluches of Communism."
"I love watching this not because I'm a solid BBM,  but because Toni made interviews that is considered unbiased and I admire it. 
Love you Toni. Don't mind those bashers,  critics,  and haters. We're here to support you. Ô∏è"
This is such an enlightening interview. I never heard BBM badmouthing any politicians. Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
Interview with full of substance... Two smart people talking. Worth the time watching.
‚ÄúI have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now‚Äù
"I really felt the sincerity from his mouth. The History was far different.

God bless you Marcoses üáµüá≠"
"Sana si Marcos talaga ang manalo
Salamat toni ikaw ang daan para malinawan ng husto ang mga pilipino"
"This is one of the best video I‚Äôve seen. When BBM was talking it was full of genuine emotion. His father was the best President of the Philippines. According to my Korean Father in law Ferdinand Marcos was a great leader and if he wasn‚Äôt ousted before the Philippines may have been one of the  richest, strongest and most powerful country nowadays like Japan and Korea. He also said that even Russia looked up"
"A humble and intelligent person with a good heart. So sad and i really cried when he uttered a part of his father‚Äôs last glance, grabe!  He deserves to win! Go Go Go BBM! Our next President!!! Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"""If you javen't made an enemy, you haven't done anything.""
-BBM
SUCH A STRONG SPIRIT. MAN OF HIS WORDS AND HONOR."
"This Toni Talks with Sen. BBM created a Domino effect of watching more videos, documentaries and articles about the Marcoses. I hope this will be the start of a Great Awakening of this Generation and realize the HUGE MISTAKE that Filipinos did during his Father‚Äôs Era - Be blinded and hidden the right to see and hear the truth that Aquinos did."
‚ÄúPinoys are the best‚Äù. Nothing could move me to tears right now other than these words.
"Maraming pilipino ang namulat sa lahat ng sinabi mo. At hindi na po ako magtataka kung makabalik po ang mga Marcos para mamahala sa PilipinasÔ∏è. Dama ang bawat salita.  God bless you po Former Senator BBM.

My realization to Senator BBM."
2.6M views in just 3 days. One of the most viewed interview with a politician. Iba pa din tlga ang supporters ni Mr. Marcos!
I actually repeated to watch BBM's LAST LOOK at his father. I also cried a lot. You can really feel the love despite what they were going through at those times.
"Competence Experience Vision Leadership Nationhood WALA NA FINISH NA PRESIDENT FERDINAND ""BONGBONG"" MARCOS SURE WIN 2022üáµüá≠Ô∏è"
"Paulit ulit ko tong pinapanuod ang interview ni BBM! BBM is a humble and clever person.
I will vote for you Sir! 
Nabilog man kaming mga kabataan datin dahil sa maling turo nung elementary pa kami.Ngayon ,gising na kami sa katotohanan.Kaya pala mga Lolo't Lola ko Daddy mo ang bukambibig.Ô∏èÔ∏è"
You are such a great inspiration  This interview made me burst into tears in a good way. Mabuhay üáµüá≠ Philippines!
"I almost cry, when his father said "" I will never hurt the people I defended for years"" the noble leader will rise once again."
Yung mga stories at information na sinasagot ni sir bong bong marcos ang dapat na nasa history books at hindi ang bias at one sided information na diniscuss sa mga paaralan. Very chill lang ang interview pero you'll learn things from him. Napaka sarap pakinggan
"Teachers and books make us blind to see the truth

"Loved the way how sir bongbong answered all Toni's questions. He was so natural, not bragging nor plastic. Besides he is a very cool person. Praying for you and your family sir. You are a very good person just like your father."
"Personally, I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with the interview. Why do people make a fuss out of it. Let‚Äôs spread peace, love and kindness to make this world a much better place to live"
"Kudos to both of you! This interview showed how loving  can a son be to his doting father,  a leader and a person even after all these years. Marcoses had contributed something good for the country in one way or another and we cannot change that."
"This interview is very casual, neutral. But we cannot deny that BBM spontaneously answers the questions with eloquence. One trait of a true leader.  Toni, certainly handles the entire interview better than the other journalists."
"The Best Part Of This Toni Talks 13:22 
‚ÄúThe Last Look or The Farewell Look‚Äù
My tears are down on my eyes "
Happy Birthday to the man who needs no introduction.   I hope and pray that you will continue the legacy of your father.  Philippines deserves the best! Stay safe and healthy BBM! Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
"Ang galing ng Bon-Bong Marcos.. Astig magsasagot.. from casual to serious to intellectual, mana sa tatay !"
"Ganda ng topics habang nagsasalita c BBM lalo akong napapamahal makikita mong me respeto sa kapwa nya Pilipino at proud na sya ay Pilipino at ramdam mo na sa puso nya ang pagtulong sa kababayan pilipino 
Mahusay Matalino at May Puso at yan ang gusto ko ke BBM
Salamat ke Apo Lakay FEM"
"Grabe ang iyak ko, ramdam ko yung sincerity. God bless you BBM üáµüá≠"
My lolo's favorite President. Even called my clever son little Marcos because President Marcos was so smart. My lolo kept on talking about President Marcos' greatness. The greatest President of all time.
"‚ÄúI have spend my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now.‚Äù‚ÄîFEM
That‚Äôs sad. Most Filipinos betrayed him by getting brainwashed"
In the whole video I‚Äôm just smiling and said to myself. if this became the president of the Philippines I think it will become successful country and most peaceful 
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this interview. Period!
"He speaks fluent english and answer questions quickly, directly with sense"
"""Pilipinos deserve better then to be treated as a second class citizens""-BBM   ""I wish we were never colonized""-BBMüáµüá≠ a true Patriotic and Nationalist Pilipino"
mas magandang magalit sila ng magalit kay Toni para paulit ulit nila panoorin tong video. at isa ito sa makakatulong sa pagpapanalo kay BBM! SOLID!
"Sir! BBM Speechless ako sa mga kasagutan mo sa mga katanungan syo ni Mam Toni Gonzaga!...I remember tuloy what your Dad say Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos...""THIS NATION WILL BE GREAT AGAIN""...Mabuhay ka Sir Bong Bong Marcos!!!...Kasama mo po kaming Lahat sa iyong Landas na tatahakin!...May the Blessing of Our Dear Lord Be With You Always!!!... Mabuhay Ka Sir Bong Bong Marcos!!!...."
I  really  love this interview.. yon ‚ÄúNATIONHOOD‚Äù na word grabe proud to be filipino talaga
I loved this. He is very articulate yet humble. No sugar coating!
I didn‚Äôt expect this. The way both of you speak is just awesome. I finished this almost 29-minute vlog without even feeling bored. Hoping for more vlogs like this.
God send Toni G. as the instrument of revealing the truth about the false History of the Martial Law. God bless you BBM. Ô∏è No one can change my mind and heart to vote for you.
"If there is anyone most capable, trained, exposed and qualified to bring back the Philippines and the Filipinos to where they truly belong...it would have to be this guy..."
I watched this twice already... I love toni and how BBM answered intelligently and he showed his sincererity and love to Filipinos...
Mrs.Toni received a lot of hate just because she's doing a great job by interviewing BBMÔ∏è
Dati ayaw ko sakanya Kase sa mga nababalitaan ko nong kapanahonan Ng kanyang ama. Pero Ngayon naiintindihan Kona .Ramdam ko sa puso ni BBM ang pag mamahal sa bayan. GO BBM FOR PRESIDENT 
this is what a TRUE interview is. no side comments and no overtalking. unlike KAREN DAVELA's ROTTEN STYLE
"What a brilliant interview, never seen like it before, so interesting no dull moment, the answer was instant right after the question. Really enjoy this. Thanks Toni for making this possible."
"I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with this interview.

I‚Äôve seen a few posts saying that Toni is not a journalist or at least along in that calibre. But putting the controversies that come with BBM‚Äôs surname aside, we should recognize that BBM‚Äôs strategy is brilliant. He‚Äôs living up to his father‚Äôs name, in all honesty. "
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Äù Tama! BBM FOR 2022"
"Napaka smooth lang ng usapan, ang gaan, ang ganda.
I just love the answers of Sir Bong and you did a great job Ms. Toni .. uwuuuu "
Love this interview. The way Tony delivered the questions was so professional and balanced plus an intelligent guest.
"""You don't succeed everytime"" wow I learned a lot from this interview."
I love this interview one of the best in Toni Talks. More power to you Toni! Binabalikbalikan ko tong episode na ito. God bless Toni 
"Such a humble man, Mr. Marcos. I pray he and his family are safe and will always be safe from harm."
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now"""
Very sincere and natural interview. No scripts. No make stories.

"Looking at Toni‚Äôs expression while doing the interview, she herself is very mesmerized. This one‚Äôs for the books. "
"If Marcos wins, there will be more ‚ÄúMade in the Philippines‚Äù"
"They can never put the ""MARCOSES"" down, thank u ms. Toni for this very inspiring interview...."
"I think somehow we, Filipinos deserve to hear this side of the story."
The vulnerability in his demeanor when asked about the last thing he remembered about his father made me want to vote for him even more.
napakarespeto ni ma'am Toni Magtanong and Sir Bong asweres it so well na walang sinasagasahan...napahanga mo po ako
"Dito nagstart ung interest ko sa mga MARCOS,and dying hard na ko ngaun...lagi ko ng inaabangan amh mga news about sa kanila...proud ilokano...BBM IS MY PRESIDENT"
"Sa lahat ng politicians na ini-interview si Sir.bongbong kakaiba kasi hindi ko narinig na magyabang siya,tapos ang talino lang napakaingat sumagot.unlike other politicians na walang ginawa kundi manira ng kalaban. GOD bless you Sir,  keep the humble heart and spirit always ."
"For me
 Marcos talaga the best kaya naman pag tumakbo siya as president. I will vote for him surely."
"I remember my father saying, Marcos is the best president our country had"
I remembered when i worked in a foreign country. They  know Marcos and they said he is the best President of the Philippines. And i think you have same attitude and  you speak natural and very sincere.  Continue the legacy of your father .Godbless you Sir

"Why am I rooting for BBM? Because my mom told me about my grandfather's story. He was a farmer, one of the farmers who benefited in PFM's Agrarian Reform Program. FM takes care of farmers. He had the IRRI, where  experts study how to produce quality rice and have an abundant harvest. Another thing that my mom told me, our brgy during her elementary days didn't have electricity, my grandfather, along with other men from our brgy wrote a letter to then First Lady Imelda Marcos, about the situation.  Imagine, it was a snail mail written to FL who at that time was Minister of Human Settlements, the letter was handwritten, they didn't have typewriter, yet after 3 weeks, people from Meralco came and a few days after, our barangay had electricity. This is my mom's personal experience. Would she invent this story? Of course not.  Nowadays, can we communicate with higher government officials that easily? I don't think so, but during FM's time, a letter sent by a group of farmers, was given importance and their problem was given a solution."
"If you're making your enemies angry, you're doing a great job"

"I studied in UPLB and strong anti Marcos talaga ang UP. One of the propaganda is to instill to the minds of the people that the Marcos regime was the worst. So our Professor made us interview people in nearby barangays in Laguna to interview them what life was like during Marcos, being so young and naive I was expecting negative comments. But I was wrong, like 1 out of 10 lang yung negative. Lahat puro good feedback during Marcos time. I can even remember interviewing this one security guard, I can sense his pride on his stories. Super proud daw mga tao noon to be called Filipinos because of how great our nation was. I remember presenting this assignment as a report in front of my class, in the middle of my presentation my professor cut me. He instead refocused the conversation on the usual - how terrible life was during Marcos time. I was so naive during that time and didn't even think about this. Pero now I realized, grabe pala talaga na twist ang facts. I'm from Bicol and I grew up hating the Marcos but now I know better."

"Marami lng tlga ang takot lumabas ang katotohanan. Toni just gave us the chance to know what is the truth. Well, it's up to us to believe what we want to believe..."
President Marcos is a visionary .
I am praying that you are going to run for presidency because I also want to experience the good things of Pres. Marcos did in his time. You are more than qualified to be one.
"That ""No, I thank you for taking the trouble"" -BBM
Salute to Toni "
Professionalism of both is commendableÔ∏è.
I love how BBM tell the story of his childhood as the son of a former President. Yes Philippines was a lot better during the time of Marcos then the Aquinos and their cohorts ruined everything. FM was the best President but not for the oligarchs that‚Äôs why they connived with the greedy Aquinos to spread lies about him so the people will get angry with the Marcoses. Hope you will the next president of the Philippines and live again in Malaca√±ang. MABUHAY KA BBM! Ô∏è

TO BE HONEST.. HE'S STILL THE BEST PRESIDENT FOR ME.. actually I saw him in his glass coffin during our college field trip At Ilocos Norte..
So smart he definitely got his father‚Äôs brain and his mom‚Äôs love for Art and music . He‚Äôs gonna be a perfect president . He‚Äôs going to make Philippines beautiful and progressive again 
"Sa umpisa nagthank you na sya kay toni ""thank you for taking the trouble"" salute to Mr. BBM. proud of you Miss Toni."
"I believed everything what he said about his father, i felt his sincere...he's as intelligent as his father...hope he will be the next president! Thank you tony and because of this interview i subscribe na! Sana interview mo rin si sen. Imee, please!"
"Imagine if only the great Miriam Defensor Santiago were still alive, 
She'll definitely support him."
Thanks Tony for the historic interview with BBM the Next president of the Philippines
Ang dami kong nakikitang maka-BBM. Sana manalo na sya as President. Hindi na ko makapaghintay.

I don't say that Im pro Marcos but you can see his sincerity throughout the conversation and we should stop putting hate to him, just because of what his father did.  Just saying "
Boses palang ni BBM kontento na aku.that feels likes Good things is Coming..Godbless Us All 
I'm certain that 2022 is his year. His patience and moral virtue despite the backlash he receives from stupid hypocrites are going to pay off very soon. Let's just hope that he won't be cheated out again.
The bashers made this interview more and more popular.I think there are those people who aren't even aware of it.It's a blessing in disguise.
Parang ngayon lang ako na excite na magboto sa susunod na election.
"Heavenly father I pray that you keep the person reading this alive,safe,healthy and financially blessed. Amen."

I hope na nabuhay ako nung panahon ni marcos .  Im so proud sa lahat ng ginawa nya sa philippines para maahon ang lahat ng panahon nya 
If Youtube and facebook was there during the Marco's era I wonder if the history will be the same.
"After watching this‚Ä¶ impressed and proud . napakatalino ni BBM then I realised also na laking talo ng mga Filipino ng iluklok ng smartmatic si fake vp‚Ä¶napaka SYONGA! Every talk ni fake vp .. sumasakit ulo ko kc  lahat yata adjective, walang subject, verb at period lahat comma. No sense at all. Dapat BBM for president. He is ready! We deserved the best!"
She knows she is talking to our next President.
Ito ulit ako. Inuulit ko na naman to. Kakaiyak kasi. Ô∏è
No wonder the late Sen. Miriam Santiago choose him as her running mate. #BBM2022
Once again Marcoses should back in the Palace! I cant wait to see them to bring back our country great again.. 
"I remember my granny always says, nung panahon ni Marcos, walang mahirap na nagugutom. May rasyon ng nutriban. Yung tinapay na di mo maubos sa isang kainan. yung piso, napakalaking pera. Napakarami mo ng mabibili. I hope BBM will be our next President‚Ä¶ I am heartily looking forward for the good deeds he can do for the Filipinos Ô∏è"
"Halos ilang araw na din akong nag mamarathon ng Marcoses interviews and history. Wala kong masabi, maybe this is God's perfect time para itama ang maling akala ng nakararami at mamulat ang lahat sa pagbabago na deserve ng buong sambayanang pilipino. Former President Ferdinand Marcos is surely in peace and happy right now, na nakikita nyang time is the truth teller. Thank you Former President Ferdinand Marcos sa napaka gandang history na iniwan mo at sa napaka gandang pag lilingkod para sa bansang Pilipinas."
"I am a part-time english teacher and most of my Japanese students know a lot about the Marcoses. I was actually shocked since i find it quite unusual. To my surprise, they said a lot of good things about FEM and that they were a fan of  him. Imagine even foreigners know and praise FEM. Made me proud to be a Filipino. We cannot deny that he made the Philippines really great during his term. He was an actual leader. I hope BBM wins the presidency and continue his father's vision for our country.

I may not witness His leadership (Press.Marcos)but seeing this interview and watching a lot of Senator Bong2's interview made me realized that the Filipinos and the Philippines need someone like Him-a wise and goal oriented leader. Some people saw Him as a dictator but i saw him as a father of the nation loved the Philippines and it's citizens- ùì£ùì™ùîÇùì≠ùìÆùì∑ ùì¢ùì™ùìµùìøùì≤ùì™
Congratulations Toni. Ginising mo ang ibang pinoy sa interview na ito. May mga walang paki kay Marcos pero nagkaroon ng interest. May mga tahimik na loyalist pero nagkaroon ng boses. Binash ka man ng iba pero mas madami ang tinanggap mong suporta katunayan yang patuloy na pag dami ng views nito at ang lumulobo mong followers.

"When bong bong marcos said: ‚ÄúNo, I thank you for taking the trouble‚Äù to Toni really shows that he knew all along that interviewing him would led to receive a lot of hate and criticism. Despite that Toni is still brave for putting up this interview. I admire her courage!"
Side of the Opposition bashing Toni makes the public watched this episode more and see how unbiased and how light it was. No sign of politics purely soul conversation. I saw how genuine BBM answered  regarding his experience with his father as a son. Thank you Toni!! Never mind malicious people just continue do to your job. There is nothing wrong with this interview Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è

"I always remember my Father said that Pres. Ferdinand Marcos is the greatest president of the Philippines, he always tell me stories of how he admire Pres. marcos and my father is just a farmer. He said that during Marcos' reign there are no problems for farmers like him that they are earning just fine. Unlike today that they are being bargained too low. He also named my brother Ferdinand, that's just how much he admire Marcos. Ô∏è"
habang nanood ako tulo luha ko subra ako napaiyak  don't worry Mr. BBM my family and relatives always support you and please tuloy mo ang nagawa nang father mo nasa sayo ang tunay na pagbabago nang bansa natin!  BBM and Duterte for president and vice president sure win po Ô∏è
I met Senator BBM he was a nice guy down to earth. Walang Arte SA katawan. Kahit ano pang paninira sa kanya sya parin ang President koÔ∏èÔ∏è
"Not a fan of Bongbong but whenever he speaks you'll know he's well educated, very passionate and he really knew what he was saying. Nakaka-hook siya pakinggan."
"I‚Äôve always admire Bong Bong. He‚Äôs well mannered, never sounded mad, bitter & vindictive to anybody that said something about him or his family. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm calling all Filipinos there in the Philippines to vote for him if he runs for any office including the Presidency."
"Grabee nung napanood ko to, nakakapaiyak. Kasi kung maiintindihan mo yung kabuuan, wala silang tinapakan na kahit sino man. Sobrang salute ako the way Toni asks questions and yung mga answers ni BBM ay sobrang totoo at sobrang touching lang."

One of the best interviews of toni aside from Candy Pangilinan.
"My very own first vote will be for BBM. I like Leni, she's good also but I think she  lack the qualities of being a President. I don't need a puppet President who can't decide on his/her own and depends only to his/her political party."
"That, ""tired of hearing lies which are already disproven"".  Mainstream media should play a big role in letting people know the truth, it is part of their social responsibility. Sadly, some, if not most, are being biased, used for the advantage of others or are purposely misinforming for clicks (clickbait), etc. Corrupting the minds of those people who are lazy for research or reading. Leaving the quote ""whoever controls the media, controls the mind""."
‚Äúthank you for taking a trouble‚Äù grabe kayo kay bbm simula bata hanggang ngayon grabe pagbabatikos nyo saknya pero hindi pa rin sya naging toxic na tao bagkus lalo nya pinrove na pinalaki siya ng maayos at sa magandang mga ugali ng mga magulang
"Mainstream media should learn from Toni. If Toni was a professional journalist, her passion for her job will supreceed Karen Davila and the whole organization of Rappler."

"I love the way his father said that ""Don't just read it, but learn from it."""
"When Marcos said "" I have spent my life protecting the Filipino's, I cannot hurt them now"" and It hit me  We have been taught a different version in our elementary days that the Marcos was this and that. I just felt so Happy that atleast on this Day they would receive the privileges that they should have deserved !!! I can't stop being so emotional right now "
"The difference between Leni and Bongbong when being interviewed; when it's Leni, you get more disappointed but when it's Bongbong, you get more enlightened. Ô∏è #BBM2022"
"""I've spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I can't hurt them now."" I can at least say that this is really true. My father used to be in military, and he told me before that if president Marcos wanted to fought back, he really can. All the soldiers at that time were just waiting for his command to attack."
"With all his family have gone through I see no single hate on his heart, just understanding"
"Good job Toni! Twice ko na pinanood ang interview na ito.  I'm one of the Marcos Loyalists.  I still remember that during our elementary days, may libre naming nutribun, milk, etc. One thing I cannot forget and should be applied today: "" SA IKAUUNLAD NG BAYAN, DISIPLINA ANG KAILANGAN"""

I‚Äôll vote for him!!! Very calm and the way he answered all the questions from Toni is very straight forward! The best episode! Kudos to Toni for being fair to all the guest!
"This kind of interview really matters, No holds barred
, Balance, Non-Bias, and spot-on. Kudos Toni"
"This interview has been trending on youtube for about a week now. It has been gaining more viewers and likes everyday. Indeed, Bongbong Marcos is a smart, genuine, true, straightforward, brilliant, and confident person. He has a wonderful charisma when he speaks. Indubitably, the Philippines needs another Marcos to lead this country. Let us all unite and support him to become the next President of our country. Finally, let us never allow another Yellowtard to rule our beloved country. #NeveragaintoDilawans"
Lord protect this man at all cost.
"I love the way he described the Filipinos. Better to hear this interview, no HATE. Very different from other politicians in mainstream media, siraan at pilit hinihila ang iba para lang sila ang umangat. #Awaken"
Binabalik balikan ko talaga ito. Bilang isang batang 90's parang nararamdaman ko yung sincerity ni sir Bong.

Isa sa pinaka magandang interview na napakinggan ko sa larangan ng kasaysayan. Kaya naman I am here again for the nth time napakasarap ulit ulitin pakinggan. I cry everytime I listen to this. Obvious na sa lahat na siya ang nanalo 2016 palang. Pero kung Smartmatic nanaman ang gagamitin or mamanipulahin nananaman ay grabe naman talagang kaawa awa. Kaawa awa HINDI si  Bongbong Marcos kundi TAYONG mga Pilipino. Sabi ng lolo ko nung time ni Marcos proud Pinoys tayo. Itong interview makikita mo ang napaka talinong pakikipag usap. Saka hindi centered sa sarili at paninira sa iba kundi para sa pangkalahatan ang laging goals niya. Ewan ko nalang talaga sa mga nabubulagan padin until now na akala mo pinanganak nung panahon ng regime ni PFEM para manghusga.

This is probably the best book i‚Äôve ever read about the life and adventures of the late president FEM. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs still available on the market. If you can find one, buy it. I can guarantee, you‚Äôll gonna love it."
"That deep voice of BBM is like the soul of his father guiding him. A future great leader to be, let us support BBM and let us make the nation great again."
"Kahit ulit ulitin ko itong interview, nakaka inspire, kung parejas na soft spoken,  magalang, matalino at mapagbigay hindi ka magsasawa na panoorin. God bless you both Toni and BBM."
nakaka touched yung pagiging family oriented nya...halatang mahal na mahal nya ang pamilya nya at proud sya na isa syang Marcos..yan ang klase ng taong mamahalin at papahalagahan lahat ng nasa paligid nya..

"In martial law time, I was 11 years old then.
The Marcos era was the best time in our history when it comes to love of country... 
I love the Marcoses!"
"This was pure. Not something that a usual politician would tell, something na halatang ""pilit"" sa ibang politician na para to gain the public sympathy. You see, bbm kase there's weight to every words he said, enlighting actually. His answers was all pure and natural walang halo, it was even as if he was happy reminiscing his past days with his father parang normal conversation that you would normally tell to someone. "
"If there is one thing I've learned from this man is no matter how hatred you are by the world, gaano man kabigat ang mundo sa'yo, find the reason to  get up every day and continue living!  Life is indeed beautiful,andaming sorpresa.  If you've discovered your purpose, no one could stop you from fulfilling it.

Para kong nakinig sa kwento ng Professor ko nung college.. yung every story ng life niya.. nakaka inspired and at the same time may matututuhan ka..
Napakabuting Halimbawa tlga ni Bong bong SA ating lahat SA kilos SA salita at SA gawa..Ang aking pagboto Kay bong bong ay para SA anak ko SA magiging anak ng aking anak at SA susunod na henerasyon ng aking pamilya dahil saknya mo tlga makikita Ang pagmamahal SA ating inang bayan.. mabuhay Po kau sanay makamayan ko Po kau ng Personal bilang pasasalamat
Di ko napansin almost 29 minutes palang videong to!.. nakakapanindig balahibo yung sinabi nyang nationhood that we are proud to be a Filipinos... proud Civil Engineer here! Born 1982..
kahit na anong masasamang salita ang pinakakawalan laban sa pamilyang Marcos they never talked bad and the way they speak are full of wisdom. Indeed!Marcos was the best and will be the best President for Filipinos and Philippines!
"The way he speak , he's very smart and straightforward. Hindi mo makikitaan ng uncertainty. He is very sure of every word that he utters."
"Idk why. But Marcos seems really sincere..
I want to hate him like what others says but, really.. he seems light, sincere..the concern is there..  you can feel the way he speaks, the body language..straightforward.. and the thought of the late Mirriam Santiago chose him, that means something..
goodjob to Toni for interviewing him.. even subscribed to Toni because of this interview."
Watching BBM makes me cry. He just love and so proud of Filipinos.
Masarap pakinggan ang galing ni BBM paulit ulit kng pibapanood sana ito ang daan para magising  ang ibang pilipino na sarado pa rin ang isip

Right! I see the logic if the late President Marcos is a true dictator . Magiging madugo ang People power sa history ng Pilipinas because the power of the army is in the hands of the president."
"I am praying for a good time that he really become a president and fulfill the dreams that his father failed to continue to do when he was alive, even so the late President Marcos was and still is up to now the best president of the Philippines üáµüá≠ for me."
God will never cancel you Toni. Do what you believe is right and just.
"New generations were being blinded with the truth about Marcos leadership.  This time around, as an ordinary citizen, it will be a great honor for me to vote for Bong Bong to show my appreciation to his father.  I think it is not fair to say bad things on him.  He is a different person.  He is the only presidential candidate who doesn‚Äôt throw any shades to any candidates we have - for me this is one of the many traits of a good leadership.  If you guys wanted to associate marital law with Bong, well, I was born during martial law and all I could say it was the best Philippines we have.  1986 onwards, the country tumbles down economically and made the country from best to worst.  Philippine history needs major correction.  These are my personal thoughts.  Peace"
"Since I was born,MARCOS SUPPORTER na ako,my first vote was  for Late Pres Marcos,2nd was for Tatay Digong and I'm sure if God's willing,my 3rd vote will be for BBM in presidential seat,last 2016 BBM is my VP.
Di ako bumoto don sa mga ibang nagdaang pangulo.
Proud to be the first student who tested the nutribun ,I was in Grade 6 that year in Mindanao,in Gensan."
"BBM lng ang politician na kilala ko never nagsalita ng masama sa kapwa even what happened to his family... Tunay na matalino dahil ginagamit ang pinagaralan sa salita at sa gawa. And BBM is a good son brother husband and a father so i can tell he can be a better best president to anyone. Totality of his personality im sure his a good person w a good heart, thank you ms toni for guesting BBM,"
Within 4 days only nasa 3m na viewers...ibig sabihin madami pa din ang naniniwala kay BBM..our next President of the Philippines...BBM solid!
This vlog surely catapults BBM in securing the presidency. Thanks Toni for this!
"This is the reason why I do love supporting BBM and Marcos Family,"
"Dati nung bata ako, my grandgrand ma always told me that Ferdinand Marcos is the best president. 

Btw, she's already 102  years old and still living. "
"He should be the man to be the president,not only he‚Äôs well educated,been around the world,speaks fluent English and have witnessed the struggle of the Philippines and the Filipino citizens I vote you BBM FOR PRESIDENT!greetings from Canada üá®üá¶."
I got teary eye while listening. I wish we could become the best nation someday.
"No skipping. 
Naiyak din ako sa part na si former president MARCOS.
""THE LAST LOOKED"""
Toni I salute you for interviewing bongbong marcos...ill support marcos forever...bongbong marcos for president
"Nakakaiyak lang, kung ano2x pinaglalagay sa mga aklat sa paaralan. Sinisiraan ang isang taong wala namang hangad kundi mapabuti ang kanyang bayan."
"Pag naging Presidente ng bansa si BBM, saka pa lang ulit siguro ako magiging proud maging isang Pilipino. Sana nga manalo ka sir! "
I asked my 94 year-old grandfather kung ano masasabi niya tungkol kay Marcos. He said that maganda daw ang pamamalakad noon. He even said na magaling daw na president c Marcos. I also asked him about the martial law at sabi ni grandpa hindi naman daw buong Pilipinas ang may martial law during that time. Yun lang daw mga places na magulo. Hindi naman daw nakakatakot noon kahit may martial law.
BBM is a visionary leader like his dad.. We need more leader like BBM.
"Basta ako 8years n ako botante,,never ako Ng boto,,ngaun tatakbo si BBM ..eto Ang kauna unahan ko mag botoÔ∏è"

"President Ferdinand Marcos can never be forgotten hes a legend..very intelligent and dedicated  his life for our country ,yes he is always be remembered and pray that he will rest in peace,whatever he did  he will face the judgement but Mercy triumph over judgement as quoted in the letter of St. James...please let him rest in peace..God loves him"
There were no LAST WORD but there was that LAST LOOK. (goosebumps)
"Nakakaiyak tlga to, nagising yung natutulog kong damdamin . Thank you #BBM"
"Hi Ms Tony alam namin maraming nag babash sayo dahil sa video na 'to. Gusto ko lang malaman mo na I am happy you are not bias, you did a good job and we are proud of you. You have us. fighting!"
"pumunta ako dito to educate myself. aside from it, nagpaiyak pa pala AHAHA  he's an intelligent man."
"Just remember, Toni has the right to interview whoever she wants to interview. There‚Äôs no need for backlash if you don‚Äôt like the interviewee. The point of interviews are so the people can listen and make their own judgment. 

Toni asked very professional questions. She interviewed Leni and other politicians, it‚Äôs only reasonable to interview BBM too. "
"What a beautifully-hearted person Bongbong is! Sana siya na, if it's God's Will! SO BE IT!"
"Ms. Toni, please know that what you've that with this interview is purely expressing the freedom of every Filipino. Freedom of speech. Don't feel bad, people will always have something to say about you especially if it is something they don't like but just do you. "
"We appeal for part 2, Miss Toni! I enjoyed watching this video. When sir Bong bong said that his father is a real leader and has a vision, he meant it. He knows how his father works and it shows his admiration for his father.  It‚Äôs not making sense why people hated this video, but I can tell most loved it! More views as compared to Leni‚Äôs interview. Haha this has more sense  on our part, this interview is fair."
"""If you're making your enemies angry you are doing a good job."""
"Just a 28 minute interview, but learned lifelong wisdom..."
"The best part of this interview is for BBM to look back into his training as a young child. Ganun dapat ang parents: they show what they do to their kids, and ask for an opinion from them like an adult! I mean, it will make kids learn to think critically for themselves when they grow up! Magandang pamantayan sa magulang ang isinasali ang mga anak sa iyong trabaho para may ideya sila. Ngapala napansin ko English ni sir: Laking UK nga... hehehe... Imbes na sabihin when I was sick, yung when you are ill... typical British. Hehe. Pero I think beyond his stay sa UK hindi iyon ang rason kung bakit very charming si BBM. Charming ang life nila as a family. I had the privilege of visiting the original residence of his dad in Batac: You would seriously doubt the veracity of plunder against the entire family because I just saw a simple home. Typical working class old wooden furnitures, mga crochet curtains.. then coming inside Marcos' room parang I smelled a hint of intelligence. This interview resonates that feeling about how Apo Lakay was as a man: typical single minded visionary. Mga war relics lang nakita ko noon. Hindi mahilig mag hoard si Apo Lakay ng mga luxury items. And if you watch his dad's interviews: he is not a palaaway, very forthright sumagot ng tanong (and sometimes remarkably witty.) May Alpha traits kumbaga. So BBM is lucky not to have a smart dad. But a dad, who is truthful, who has nothing to hide. By the way, I do not want as much to incite this but people do not know that a large tract of land from the Marcoses is a State University. Yes, Marcos was brave because he is not scared to educate people! Corrupt politicians sensationalize and fabricate truths and are terribly terribly horrified to lead a nation of people who think. Yan na. The truth is always self evident. It does not need to talk even. (Tamaan mga maingay na puro pukol ginagawa... ehehehe.)"
"Ang gaan ng interview na to. Haaay, don‚Äôt mind the haters. Ito yung manok ko for president. Ang bait ng awra niya Ang gaan niya kausap. Yung habang nagsasalita siya mapapatitig ka habang nakikinig."
"My take on this Interview is that, Toni only showed in a subtle manner who Bongbong really is, as a Person. A good natured and meaningful interaction. If the Interviewer were the likes of Korina Sanchez, it would have geared to Politics and Marcos regime. Bongbong only has praises for his Dad because after all, he is his father's Son who look up to his Dad and witnessed how he worked hard on his position and he only elaborated the priviledged life they had, depicted as children of the President. And a Son as he is, Bongbong and his Dad are still two different people. Bongbong demonstrated no cynicism and no loathing for people who judged them for their Last Name. Because true to that, No Politician will never be criticized whether he do good or bad. He only uttered factual occurence. Never bad mouthed anyone. Having the priviledge to study and live in the West, he is even more Filipino than those Filipinos I know who also had the opportunity to study and live abroad. Bongbong Marcos is an eloquent, spontaneous, optimistic and an Intellectual man. In this Interview, we came to know who Bongbong Marcos really is. He is a man with substance, with conviction, dignified, has morals and Integrity."
"When people cancelled toni, because of this interview, while they did not reacted to other toni's interview with the politicians, dun mo tlga makikita ang pagkabias, first time voter here (29 years of existence) and I will vote for you sir, nagparegister talaga ako for you. Agbiag ti ilocano! Suportaan da ka la unay #forthePhilippinesÔ∏è #solidnorth"
Siya ang gusto Kong maging vice noon 2016. pero Sana Kung gaano kadami ang nanood Ng vlog na to mas marami pa ang bomoto saknya bilang president Ng pilipinas dito Tayo SA totoong may malasakit.BBMForpresident
This interview seals my Marcos loyalism.
I would like to personally thank Tony Gonzaga for this.
"""put yoyr guns down, we'r not shooting anyone"" now i understand and see how  good FM is  he has a golden heart din :("
Bbm deserve's to be a president and rule the Philippines like his dad done before 
sobrang ganda ng interview.. u know the side that we never heard of only ms. toni open us to these kind of conversation ...so heartwarming and thirst for more ..
So amazing interview 5x ko nang pinanood paulit ulit...
Watching this video... I feel it comes from the heart... Among the three candidates... You are the ONE.
"I admire a lot former senator Miriam Depensor Santiago because of her unbelievable talks and dream into our nation.
She support BBM because she knows the Best."
He has all the quality of a president he deserve the position to become the next president of the philippines..
"After watching both interviews, it only shows who is more capable of being on the position of presidential and who‚Äôs not.  Let‚Äôs vote wisely. Who doesn‚Äôt just want a revenge for the marcoses or duterte. Someone who can change or improve for the betterment of our country. Someone who shows a platform that will uplift the Filipino people. But I really like how toni gonzaga shows that she‚Äôs professional and not just one sided person. Thank you for this "
such an intelligent human being. salute to you sir
"umiiyak ako,touching kc yung father n son story."
"Was curious why people are bashing Toni G. until i watched this episode, there's nothing to bashed about, BBM has the sinceer answers to all the questions, now I know why my dad idolized this man.."
"Democracy=freedom of rights, freedom to speak, freedom to think of what‚Äôs right and wrong and freedom to choose whose side are you on. I see nothing wrong in this interview still not a BBM fan though but I do understand where he is coming from"
Magaling ang mga marcos at ang pinapanalangin ko manalo siyang presidente... TAMA NA DILAWAN... GISING N ANG MGA TAO...

"mistake is part of being human, FERDINAND E. MARCOS is the best President of the Republic of the Philippines. No one is perfect but he try his best in his on way."
"The last look of President FEM means: 
I will leave our nation and countrymen to you my son, save our country not now but in the future."
You can't dictate or stop BBM to talk about his personal experience with his father.

"Thats why Dilawan are so 
Mad. In this interview Bongbong show how Witty he is. Very calm, funny & most of all  he said was a  little side of his father  w/c the Pilipinos never & will never known if not for this interview. Very simple question of Toni  in a moderate way was answered by Bongbong . Flowing happiness from His heart how he  honored, respect, proud & love his father the way he was brought  up  & become  what he is now was coming from his heart. What is wrong of that dilawans. 30 years never stopped accusing Pres Marcos of LIES. You all know the truth that  your LIES is NOT  TRUE . The truth is Ninoy Aquino & Jomar Sison are partners in Crime they are the LEADERS of NPA, CDD & NDF. And Sison is living in another country in a very comfortable life & trying to manipulate how he can come back & make the Philippines a Communist country.  And this dilawans because they are greedy of Money they follow whatever Jomar Sison wants because of Money. MONEY & MORE money. You are all PATHETIC dilawans. Sorry for my English because Im not a college graduate."

pangalawang beses kona pinapanood to ang saya padin ng puso ko
i have learned so many things about his story.
"Thanks Toni G.. for this interview ..Kay  Bong Bong R.

"I am dumbfounded at the same time emotional. Living in Mindanao, I remember my grandparents‚Äô stories while we took long walks in our ‚Äúbasakan‚Äù that no matter what people say against Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, he will always be a great leader to them. Now watching this video interview with my 7 and 9 yo kids, and them asking me, ‚ÄúMom pls tell us more about Marcos.‚Äù is enough to make me teary eyed. Legacy lives. Truth will always come out. Truth outlives historical lies."
"Made me cry when he said "" I spent my whole life defending the Filipinos, I can't hurt them now""...words from real leader and a true father of the Filipino nation. Bravo!"
This interview gave me chills. He speaks so highly of us as a Filipino. The best leader is someone who has faith to his people. They want to elevate us as a nation and as a country so we can reach our full potential. We are not 3rd world country and we can level with other 1st world countries so let us be wise and choose the right LEADER.
I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now dito na ko nagsimulang maiyak  I wish mameet ko talaga si Sir  Ferdinand Marcos at mapasalamatan sya ng sobra sobra sa pagmamahal sa ating bansa at sa ating mga Filipino Ô∏è
"Masarap makinig sa taong malalim at may mga halaga ang sinasabi. I like it when he said "" Pinoys are the best. Kahit anong ipagawa mo, back up mo lang magagawa ng maayos "". We also need a leader that is affirmative and yet strong in his principles. #BBMforPRESIDENT"
"My tears suddenly fall down as I heard the words, ""I had spent my whole life defending the Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now."" I see a heart of being a father to the nation. At naranasan ko ang pagiging tatay ni FEM sa mga bata sa Pilipinas dahil I was born in 1985 & the following years until FEM stepped down from Malaca√±ang naranasan namin na nakaluwag sa buhay dahil may support ang pamahalaan na mga 1st class na gatas, csm, bulgor at nutri bun. Papa ko farmer nakaranas ng kaginhawaan sa pagsasaka dahil sa Masagana program ng pamahalaan. Ang nangyaring rally noon kahit nga hanggang ngayon sa Manila lang naman naganap hindi nman ngrally buong Pilipinas. Yung mga nagrarally di naman supporter ng pamahalaan yan. Sa simula pa lang anti government na mga yan. Kahit sino presidente ilagay sa pwesto may magrarally pa rin kasi nakadikit na sa kanila ang masamang espiritu ng pagka rebellious na pag may hindi gusto sa pamamalakad ng pamahalaan gusto lagi idaan agad sa pag aalsa, sigawan at dahas at alam niyo po namamana at namamana yang masamang espiritu na yan sa sunod pang henerasyon kaya be careful po kayo dahil di po mabuting espiritu ang maipapamana niyo once mainvolve kayo sa isang pag aalsa. In the book of Romans chapter 13 says.. Submit to Government, ""Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God‚Äôs minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God‚Äôs minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience‚Äô sake."""

You're doing great! Actually greater than many other so called big name journalists. Toni Talks is transparent, unbiased, fresh, timely and educational. You serve us with raw footage and stories, you make us choose whether to believe or not believe such stories and individuals. You give us freedom of choice, you give us democracy. Keep on being the journalist we all need, the entertainer we all want and the citizen we all should imitate. Your talk, your rules. Thank you Toni!"
wow! amazing conversation. I lived in Pres. Marcos regime. Ramdam ko lahat ng mga sinasabi ni Bong Bong Marcos. Napakasarap mamuhay nung panahon ng kanyang ama.

Napaka ganda at napaka daming lesson ang natutuhan ko sa interview ito. Thank you  Mam Toni...
While watching I also cried. His words are touching. Bakit ba galit ang iba dito? He's just sharing his experiences with his father. Sarap sa ears ang pagiging patriotic mo Sir BBM and I do believe that is what we need to develop especially to our youger ones.
I cried when BBM talked about his father‚Äôs death i felt the sincerity and the father-son connection
"When Marcos said,I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos,I can't hurt them now,guns down...pure tlga ung pagmamahal ng mga Marcos sa Bansang PilipinasÔ∏è"

Its my 5th time watching this video pero iba talaga yung tama eh. Tagos sa puso. I even shared this with my friends because this interview means a lot. Sincere and honest man. HE SOUNDS GOOD AND HE SOUNDS SINCERE!"
"i hope my lolo will keep fighting his sickness. Para maabutan pa niya ang pagbabalik ng mga Marcos. My lolo is a real pro-Marcos. Palagi niyang kinukuwento sa amin  yung mga ganap noong Marcos Era, kasi naabutan niya. Sabi niya marami daw nagawang magaganda si Marcos. Kahit paulit-ulit niyang kinukuwento sa aming mga apo niya yun, I am still willing to listen."
"""If you're making your enemies angry,you're doing a good job. If you haven't made any enemies,you haven't done anything."" -BBM"
I literally cried the part when he was talking about his father's last look.
"I literally cried watching this interview.
His father got sick because of the emotional pain. Imagine spending your life to serve people who later on want to oust you. Imagine having pure intention to help but people keep making lies about you. The worst part is when people keep hearing those lies, they start believing them. Not only that they believe  in them, they start spreading them; passing them to the next generations."
The best itong interview vlog na ito kasi nakikita natin kung gaano ka humble si Sir BongBong and how Toni handles the interview well.. Kudos to Ms Toni!

"He is sincere on all his answers. I really like BBM's patriotic attitude. All the best for the Phils on 2022! üáµüá≠
Thank you Toni for this episode. It was calm and full of sincerity."
"I love how BBM delivers those pointers and principles.
Whatever position you run, my vote is yours BBM!"
Yung sinabi nyang..  I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE DEFENDING FILIPINO.  Doon palang talagang may malasakit sya sa buong sambayanag Filipino at sa Pilipinas 
"OMG! All BBM said were true. I was in the palace before the Marcoses left for Hawaii. During the time i was there, we asked he soldiers there,  why was it that Marcos allowed the rally in Edsa, the soldier, Marcos, doesnt want to hurt the filipino people. Im having goose pimple now as i reminisced it, The soldier told us, that in few seconds, Edsa would be cleared, had the President order to. Ilang minuto lng daw ubos ang tao sa EDSA sa isang utos lng ni Marcos, pero di pumayag  si Mracos. Yan and di alam ng tao at yan ang ayaw nila paniwalaan, hatred ang nangibabaw sa tao, ultimo mga taong di naabutan ang Martial Law, galit! Grabe! Para sa akin, si Marcos pa rin ang pinaka magaling na Philippine President. Mga nasa ilalim nya ang namantala sa position and thats inevitable, Di  alam ni Marcos lahat ng galaw ng mga nasa ilalim nya, Sana, matuto ang tao na maging bukas abg isipan, Hindi puro galit. Mabuhay ka BBM! God bless your political career. I believe you very much, and definitely will support you. MABUHAY ka po!"
"Thank you Tony for this! I was mad at Marcos Family when I was teen. Studying at school hearing bad things about Marcos. But when I was able to search on my own. All pages I found is that Marcus was the best President we have ever been. Lahat nagawa nya para sa Pilipinas. I dont know! Why, sinisiraan nang sobra! But now! I know marami ang nagising sa katutuhanan. !! Marcos for 2022"
"Dati, ayaw na ayaw ko sana sa iyo, Toni, but seeing & listening to this very professional & unbias interview you did with BBM, eh, pinahanga mo ako ng sobra-sobra.  Napasubscribe na rin tuloy ako sa channel mo.  Ang galing-galing mo, Toni, and certainly is our soon-to-be President, BBM...."
"This line of our former President makes me teary eyed,
""I had spent all my life defending Filipinos, I can not hurt them now..""
Thank You Miss Toni for the courage and to this great interview to Sir BBM!"
My Boss here in Malaysia was the one who told me how Brilliant Pres. Marcos his dream is to make the Philippine like America in Asia... But my Boss said its sad Filipinos did not believe in that Vision if the Filipino believe that Vision your Country is among the Riches country but now you get out from your country to Work... Bigla akong naluha sa sinabi ng Boss ko bigla akong nahiya sa sarili ko...   
Bongbong Marcos speaks from the heart. You can see the sincerity in every words he says. He showed how real and intelligent he is as a person and a leader.
"The greatest thing I have heard and learned from this gifted son of former President Ferdinand Marcos is this:""The best thing that you can do is to help other people. Is to help many other people. As many people as you can.  And what else can you do better than that? I can't think of anything that one could do better than that ."" Amazing! A very profound  spiritual insight expressed in a very simple manner! Wow!"
"Dalangin ko kay God,  gabayan po kayo, President Bongbong Marcos, at lagi po kayo ingatan, sa lahat ng hakbang ng inyong buhay. Lagi kayo bigyan ng Panginoon ng Kalakasan. At kaligtasan ng inyong buong Pamilya. Salamat sa sakripisyo, para maunlad ang Bansang Pilipinas Ô∏è"
"Nothing wrong with this interview, so many lessons learned , we need part 2"
"When I was a student, Edsa 1 has always been labeled as a ""peaceful revolution"", with all of the facts coming in, it seems that the reason why it was peaceful was because the commander in chief instructed his armed and capable army to not hurt the Filipinos, the same people he defended his whole life."
Naiyak ako bigla  ‚Äú I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down and we‚Äôre not shooting anyone.‚Äù
"I‚Äôm no fan of Toni Gonzaga but I never get tired of watching her interview with BBM. Her questions are simple and are not penetrating, like other journalists are are doing. She was able to bring out the human side of BBM. Like BBM my eyes swell with tears when she asked the last moment of FEM. You touch the most sensitive feeling of the Filipinos with that simple question. Good job Madam Tony. Keep up the good work."

"sobrang gaang panuorin ng interview na to, 10/10 
makikita mo na sincere yung tao kung paano sila mag salita, kung paano sila tumingin, at ang emosyon habang nagsasalita sila.. MORE POWER BBM! "
"An Eye Opener interview! Im a millenial, buong akala ko and maybe they instill it in our young minds in textbooks elementary and high school that marcoses are bad guys, then when i go to college in state university we have minor subject in political science and the first topic is philippine history,our professor really explain the real history with an open mind without reading textbook or a reference, nagkwekwento lang talaga sya, and im so amazed. Na may mga bahagi ng kasaysayan na noon ko lang narinig. that's the time na nagkaroon ako ng open mind to listen, research and study what really happens in our history.We support late Sen. Miriam Defensor last election and i believe her saying that BBM as her VP is deserving and can be a brilliant president of our country!"
"There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this interview. Made me cry when He is remembering his dying father, how he looked at before passing away. Honestly that moment was both pain and hapiness, undescribable feeling. I could relate as i have lost my brother last month, how pain will never ever go away but you‚Äôll live with it. This interview focused more about His life,a son, a husband, a father and a little bit of how he is as a politician being a Marcos. Neither they stole a money from the people, we have no right to judge as we aren‚Äôt God who is rightful."
"This is the kind of leadership we need. A leader that unites and not to divide.

"My history professor once said:

""HISTORY WAS WRITTEN BY WINNERS"""
"No one can beat BBM, he is molded with a kind of characters of a great leader. the good upbringing & experience from his childhood  are the best foundation he built from within his personality. he has great vision on this country future success. dispite of the persecution he never reacted to lies & critizism , dispite he is determined with positive mindset that he can continue to fullfill the  blueprint of his father for the future success of this country."

"The Marcos siblings have class, dignity, and calmness, and without any sign of hate despite all the things that happen to them. Instead, they show admirable characters we rarely see in famous politicians today. He is a true person with good and a humble heart.

"Be honest "" who stays in the video from beginning to end, and feel like crying...."" Salamat po sa Legacy!"
"I watched his some interviews and his vlogs. I'd noticed that he never say bad words to their opponents. Unlike the other politicians they'll slur the reputation of their opponents so that they will be good to the people.  He has words of wisdom. He's very cool, humble ang intelligent person. This man has full of visions can raise Phils. and  be a better nation again~ God bless Philippines! Mabuhay~"
First time voter here. Pinush ko talaga makapagparehistro para mai-boto si BBM Ô∏è
"Grabe..ramdam na ramdam po ang mga sinasabi ni BBM. Andaming nasayang na panahon na dapat maunlad na ang bansang Pilipinas, kung ang mga namumuno ay talaga may puso para sa pagunlad ng bansa at ang mga Filipino ay naging matalino sa pagpili sa pagboto. Mabuhay ka po BBM! God bless Pilipinas."

"So humble and natural and smart answering questions Sir. Marcos.  
Salute to both of you Sir and miss Toni Ô∏èÔ∏è"
"BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO, WE WERE ABLE TO KNOW WHO ARE THE REAL DICTATOR. THANK YOU TONI G."
Grabe bawat salita nya may tatatak na lessons 
Growing up hearing criticisms about his father. He's a tough man indeed.
I believe God used Toni Gonzaga as an instrument to let people knew that Marcos are truly telling the Fact About their contribution & Legacy in the Philippine history. TRUTH always Prevails and this interview was one of those testimony ! üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠
Galing nya sumagot . May talino sya tulad ng knyang ama. Please vote bbm for president 2022 
"i can't stop watching this interview again 'n again, i just admired him for standing up to whatever the issues they have especially to his father. His words are full of sincerity and wisdom. We know just by the tone of his voice that his telling the truth (his experiences)"
One of the best and non political interviews I‚Äôve heard.
"This interview is an eye opener for some Filipinos, i admire this man and thank you Toni G for taking the courage to do this kind of interview.Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
Being born on mid 60's Pres. Marcos was  the best Philippine  President  I ever witness so far  in my entire life . Thank you Ms Toni for allowing Mr Bong Bong  as your guest. God bless you more.

"""crying for his country is not a waste,  its a worth leader."""
Nakaka-inspire naman ang sinabi ni BBM about Filipino's that we are tough in a gentle asian way...that we are good sa anuman pagawa sa atin ... Relate much as an OFW
"accept it or not maraming nagawang mabuti ang father nya sa ating bansa, yan ang mga narinig ko sa mga parents ko."
"May mapupulot ka talagang mabuting aral. Kahit ako man natuto ng life lesson kay Pres. Marcos thru his son. 

Thanks BBM, mabuhay po kayo. "
This is an eye-opening interview. Thank you so much Toni and may the good Lord be with you Sir Bong! Happy bday! #BBM2022
"there's nothing wrong about this interview... lahat tayo proud sa mga tatay natin even him,.."
"A well spoken, intelligent and confident fit to be the next President ."
"""The best you can do in life is to help other people as many as you can""."
"napakahumble ni sir BBM, inaalala nya si ma'am Toni, ung sinabi nyang no, thank for taking the trouble, alam nya n kasi ang mangyayari after the interview on him, ang galing ni ma'am Toni kasi subrang ganda ng flow ng usapan nila, nakakaiyak at nakaka proud"
Ilang ulit ko na pinapanood to. Dami Kong natutunan kai BBM sarap pakingan very professional and genuine. Ô∏è
"This is the best episode I've ever watched. The glorious days flashed back and made me emotional. Thank Ms. Toni Gonzaga for this episode. Today, I become a subscriber. "
"Wow Iba talaga ang mga Marcoses so Professional iba mag isip! 
I love this video and there's nothing wrong about it. You Got my voteÔ∏è"
"This is what Filipinos need to realize.  During that Edsa Revolution, they had the advantage militarily but they chose not to fight. And it is not written on History Books, thats why I support History Revisionism to hear the other side of the story. To make it fair for the Marcos. Let's hear them people."
"I love this interview. For the anti-marcoses, don't attack BBM just because of what happened yesterday. He shouldn't be blamed for the ""unfortunate"" events that had happened before. Not only him but all of us shouldn't be blamed for the things that we didn't do. Attack him for the things that he really did on his own."
BBM for president!  Ganito kelangan ng pinas! 
"Look at this amazing BBM  the son of the great President Ferdinand Edralin Marcos. you see how he answeres no hatred no pretenses very humble, very honest well mannered great person.   Toni Gonzaga well done on your interview."
the first sentence ‚Äúthank you for taking the trouble‚Äù damn he knows everything.
"Im not a fan if Marcos neither ""The Dilawans"", but what toni did was amazing.  Hearing the other side of the stories made me realize how diverse a filipino was. A genuine interviews. 
Thank you toni for your braveness, for taking all the blames for us to educate."
"Sa lahat ng interview mo Ms Toni dito ko naiyak kasi naramdaman ko at nakita ko, base sa mga nakikita ko ngayong panahon na ito.  During Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Marcos time after World war 2 sila ang nag restore at build ng Kanilang bansa in a similar way. They are both strict in a sense that can govern their nation. But for me Base on what i search, a long time of searching and keep asking for the truth bakit ang hirap maging Filipino, ang baba ng tingin sa Filipino this period of time. I felt relieve, now i have the answer. Thanks, hope for the best Philippines"
"I remember one of my Tourism students asked me about the infrastructures and other tourist attraction how it was build and developed, I shared to them that it was the legacy of the former President Marcos and the First Lady.... on how they work on it with the help of course of other government officials."
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now.""  FEM refused to listen to Ver to disperse the rallyists on Edsa. It would've been a bloody People Power if it weren't for FEM's selfless act."
"Ibang klase ang interview na to, ito yung interview na magagawa mong ulitin kasi napakaraming learnings sa kung ano ang totoo about marcoses. Yung sincerity & authenticity the way sen bbm answered d questions talagang tagos, malaman at totoo. Salute to Ms. Toni for this interview. Sana may part 2. Solid BBM-DUTERTE"
"The courage of a true born filipino leader!  I felt that, his words are very inspirational to the point, i cried while listening to his words. Ah how could they hate someone who have great ambitions for us, filipino. Who truly understand what the TRUE WORTH OF US, FILIPINOS."
He is so humble and so well-manered. Great breeding!

"Am 28 years old and I grew up stereotyped Marcoses as tough bastards. But For 28 mins, he showed how soft his heart is. That aint shit. "
"Ilang beses ko pinapanood naiiyak pa din ako ,, thank you miss toni"
His very smart person the way he answered the questions direct to the point. We need a man like him to lead our country. To loved the Nation and to loved our country men. The next President for 2022. 
Sobrang inspiring ng interview na to Ô∏è
"2nd time watching this..And no doubt I will VOTE for you. A MAN with vision, integrity and good intention to the Filipino people.
#BBM for President
#Election2022"
My 2nd time to watch it and can‚Äôt still get over how sincere and intelligent BBM is 
"This is the best episode in ""Toni talks"". i've learned a lot about Former Pres. Ferdinand Marcos and i can say that he is one of the best president in Philippine history.  i can see Marcoses' pure and genuine love for their countrymen. will wait for Marcos term and see how philippines will change with this man. #notoyellow  #hatersgonnahate"
"""If you're making your enemies angry, you're doing a great job."" "
Keep on interviewing Bongbong Marcos! Ang galing mo Toni.
"Even before the controversy,  this interview been racking views. BBM always talks  with substance and Toni set a friendly vibe conversation, not inquisitive nor intrusive. This is my 3rd time watching and each time still left me wanting more, part 2 coming perhaps with Sandro this time?"
"my stepfather told me that he was once with pres Ferdinand Marcos during the war,  I remember he said, Marcos fights like he have 9 life, paano aq mkakaramdam ng takot Kung ang leader namin mas bata pa sa akin Pero determinadong ipaglaban ang bansa ntin,  Marcos is a good leader"
"I remembered, my arab amo before is always talking about  Marcos. His best president of the Philippines daw ay c Ferdinand Marcos no one else, aniya.Ô∏è Happy Birthday sir Bongbong"
"I‚Äôm having mixed emotions while watching. Thank you, Toni for doing this."
"Great interview! May puso at napakaganda ng pag-uusap! Toni, part 2 please!"
"Someday, we would go out abroad and say, ""We are Filipinos.""Ô∏è"

"Like Father,Like Son,He‚Äôs speaking from the Hearth."
I watched this 4days ago and now it's not surprising that the views have escalated even more.. Indeed no one can put a good man down. 
"i dont really get the point why people are coming at toni for doing this interview. a lot of us grew up with just one story about the martial law, because the marcoses almost really never had their chances to talk about it before, nor they were even asked to do so. but to see toni use her platform to see both sides of the story just gives me chills and all. it's very rare to see people like her giving chances to people who were objectified by the majority to speak up and tell stories. bbm even said from the beginning, ""thank you for taking the trouble"" because he knew that people are gonna take this interview negatively, just like how we've always known and understood their family and his father's regime. this interview clearly has no intention of questioning the history, because this interview is about a son telling stories of him and his father."
I just don‚Äôt know why I like him to be our President. There‚Äôs something about him that would make huge impact and difference to our country‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs like so true to himself.
"at eto na nga nabalita sa GMA BBM officially announced and endorsed by Partido Federal to be their Presidential Candidate for 2022 election.. please tulungan taung lahat para ibalik ang nationhood, and para maging great again ang Pilipinas.. Let's support him! kailangan nya tau sa kanyang laban tulungan nati  sya.. let's make it happen #Bbm2022"
"Sir! BBM Speechless ako sa mga kasagutan mo sa mga katanungan syo ni Mam Toni Gonzaga!...I remember tuloy what your Dad say Pres. Ferdinand E. Marcos...""THIS NATION WILL BE GREAT AGAIN""...Mabuhay ka Sir Bong Bong Marcos!!!...Kasama mo po kaming Lahat sa iyong Landas na tatahakin!...May the Blessing of Our Dear Lord Be With You Always!!!... Mabuhay Ka Sir Bong Bong Marcos!!!...."
I remembered my nanay said that during her childhood (under Marcos' era) the basic needs are very affordable to all citizens. Maraming libreng food sa schools nila..maraming pakain sa mga brgy.. free school supplies... ang galeng...
This man is my president naging fan ako bigla after watching this interview

galing mo toni Gonzaga mga simpleng tanong na may kurot sa puso ni BBM  at sa manunuod
the best part ‚Äú thank you for taking the trouble ‚Äú BBM knows TONI  will be trending
kpag nappanood ko sa ganitong interview si BBM nasstarstruck feeling ako. Solid BBM!
"Watched again today. Can't get enough of this interview.

This is my stress reliever after a day's work."
The hardest questions he wants to cry.. the moment and memory still fresh to feel pain. We here for BBM2022
"Toni did a great job here, and our future President BBM  is just as amazing as he is,,, great work to both of them "
"I'm not fan of any interviews of any politicians, I find them boring. But this interview was... So unlikely of those. I want this man to be the next President. Thank you Ma'am Toni."
"If icocompare mo kung paano magsalita si bbm vs dilawan. Makikita mo kung sino talaga ung tunay na may malasakit sa pilipinas. Walang halong pambabatikos sa iba. Ang tanging mararamdaman mo lng eh ung pagmamahal nila sa ating mga pilipino. Unlike sa mga dilawan na laging may patama at panira sa knila or sa ibang tao. Totoo ngang hindi natatabunan pera at katanyagan ang tunay na meaning class , may karunungan at may pagmamalasakit na tao."
Everytime BBM talks I listen. Idk why lol its just he‚Äôs a wise man like his father. Very Filipino! #IsupportBBMfor2022Election
"If Nostradamus prophecy is right, Nakakaproud Ms. Toni that your a big part of that ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù.  You are the instrument that God sent to help Mr. Bongbong Marcos, viral na viral eh I hope magising na tayong mga pilipino so that Pinas will be a great country again. Agawid tay pilipinas‚Äôn üáµüá≠üá®üá¶"
"Bong bong was calm,smart and cool personality thats why I admire a lot.."
"I am watching this, mixed emotions. School taught me that Marcos' we're the main antagonist. But thenz the reality opened up in me. Nagingay ang mga dilaw, kaya napunta ako dito. Base sa kwento ng aking LOLA at LOLO na siyang nakaranas ng mga pangyayari nuong Martial Law, hindi sila nakaranas kailanman ng paghihirap. We want the Philippines be great again. I'm only 15. Please vote for me. Every vote counts. May God bless us all."
"""I wish we we're never colonized"" I felt that. "
