"Sobrang ganda ng sinasabi ni BBM about his father. Makikita mo talaga na sobrang proud siya sa daddy niya. Go BBM for president 2022. I salute you sir specially to your father. I remember when my lola said. Ferdinand marcos is the best president and he really good person he doing a good job."
"Came back to this because now he is the new President of our country. To be honest, I was undecided a few months back but I happened to watch this interview. I was amazed by his sincerity and humility. God bless you, Mr. President. God bless our country."
"I don't regret voting him. Been a silent supporter for a long time and was questioning myself if it is right to stay quiet even if people are throwing, calling them all the bad names in the world. But when he says that ""I have advantage because I know the Truth"" , it made me realize that I did the right thing. Staying quiet and doing nothing doesn't mean your weak, it's just that you know better and you're just doing the right thing than being violent towards your countrymen. God Bless the Philippines and all the Filipinos."
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down we're not shooting anyone""
-Ferdinand Marcos. 
Please sabihin niyo sakin, na hindi siya karapat dapat maihimlay sa libingan ng mga bayani 
Been a silent Marcos supporter for such a very long time and I definitely don't regret my vote for him. Set aside all the critics,"
"I feel BBM's honesty for his public service and being proud of Filipinos. May God guide you on how to really revive our nation from the nightmare of poverty, corruption, and illiteracy."
"I'm a Marcos hater then. Since my early childhood I was exposed hearing my father (RIP)and his friends talking about how bad Marcos then. Mga 9 yrs pa lang ako noon and I was not aware then that my father was a member/symphatizer of Hukbalahap syempre that time leftist sila. Nakalakihan ko na ang hatred against Marcoses. I was working in abroad when the hstoric and fateful day, EDSA People's Power erupted. I cried tears of joy seeing those people marching and staying in the streets and more so when Marcoses left the palace. I went home to Philippines and with great hope I applied for work in Malacanan and was hired in RTVM (Presidential Broadcast Staff) Close-on kami ni Tita Cory noon at immuned kami sa mahigpit ng security ng PSG tuwang-tuwa ako noon kasi nakakalapit kami shoulder to shoulder with the president. Then, as ime passed working with RTVM I realized what they were doin. We were told and assigned to do black propagandas against Marcos who at that time matagal ng patay and the family was no longer in power. Naisip ko ano ang saysay ng gingawa namn matagal ng patay si Apo Lakay binubugbog pa namin! I resigned, that was the time I changed my heart. Naisip ko peaceful naman noon kahit may martial law at naisip ko rin na kung di ka naman gumagawa ng masama e bakit ka i-presecute ng gobyerno. We, our family voted for BBM! Happy to see them back. Malacanang Redemption!"
"Ito lang talaga yung politician na wala kang narinig na paninira sa iba napaka humble. kaya sa 2022 saiyo ang boto namin. #BBM2022"
"Just bump into this video right now. Now he is the President of the Philippines. I just realized, my vote was not put to waste. It was a good decision that I voted for him. He is a man of wisdom."
"Wala akong ma afford na salita kundi maraming salamat sa ama mo at sayu. Mananaig parin ang katotohanan at ngayun yun mangyayari. Thank You Miss Toni for allowing us to know more about Marcos. Godblessyou Kaya gusto kong manuod nang Interviews mo kasi you inspire me at good example ka sa amin at lalong lalo na sakin. GodblessusallÔ∏è"
"When he said ""I have spent my whole life defending Pilipinos I cannot hurt them now""(Put your guns down and we're not shooting anyone)This strikes to the heart talaga masasabi ko talaga literal na ang hirap mahalin ang mga Pilipino  binigay na lahat-lahat kulang pa din ikaw pa masama"
"You can literally see and feel how genuine and honest he is.."
"I will never get tired watching this interview.. thank you Ms Toni for standing up for him Ô∏è Congratulations, PBBM!!! I am one of the 31M and words are not enough to express how grateful and thankful I am to GOD for answering my prayer! May God's blessings come to you a thousand fold and may God guide you and VPIS on this path Ô∏è Sama sama tayong babangon muli! üáµüá≠"
"I felt the sincerity. Talking out of reality. Hindi scripted, hindi plastic. #BBM the next president of the üáµüá≠.. May God guide & bless you po."
"I never regretted that I used my first official vote for President Bong Bong Marcos."
"""I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos, I can't hurt them now."" Words from a great man so much maligned and humiliated by his own countrymen."
"Proud filipino and a part of 31 million history of marcoses! Mabuhay ang pilipino! Mabuhay ang pilipinas!"
"This was the interview that solidified my decision to vote #BBMSARA Ô∏è. The first one was his interview with Boy Abunda. Both showed his extensive intellect for Filipino politics."
"This little interview SNOWBALLED, and created a very big LANDSLIDE."
"MY GRANDFATHER WAS A FORMER MAYOR OF TAYTAY, PALAWAN AND I REMEMBER HIM LITERALLY PAINTING A ""VOTE MARCOS"" ON A FLATTED TIN CAN... DI PA USO ANG POSTER NOON... WHEN THE MARCOSES FLED TO HAWAII MY MAMA AND AUNTIES WERE CRYING... MARCOS IS THE BEST... AND LET US ALL HOLD HANDS TOGETHER AND VOTE FOR BONGBONG MARCOS..."
"Everytime i watch President BBM's video nakaka-goosebumps and nakakaiyak. Even nung nanalo sya, i cried. I cried not because i am sad but because i am happy. He deserve it. And now, watching this video made me cry even more. How sincere he is. Minanipula talaga ang history sa schools hahaha. Panahon na ng pagbabago."
"Gandang ganda parin ako sa interview na to! The best! Hindi mag sasawa kahit paulit2 ko pang panuurin. Andami kong natutunan. Wala akong natutunan na hate or hatred. Tunay ngang lumaki sa mabuting pamilya. Dama ko yung katutuhanan. Very natural din sumagot si President Bong Bong. Congratulations President Bong Bong Marcos Jr! I'm so happy and proud na isa ako sa 31 million!Ô∏èÔ∏è"
"Pano nya ikwento lahat simula ng bata sya kitang kita kung gaanong naging mabuting tatay si pangulong Ferdinand Marcos. Ô∏èÔ∏è"
"Totoo talaga yung sinabi ni BBM, na nawala nating mga Pilipino ang pagiging proud sa nationality natin. Satingin ko dahil yan sa mga napapanood natin mula nung bata tayo. Karamihan ng balita na maririnig patungkol sa ating bansa ma pa radyo man o TV ay masama. Onti onti tayong namuhi sa ating pinagmulan. Kaya hindi natin masabi sa buong mundo na ako ay proud Pilipino. Sana nga maibalik natin ito upang maging isang totoong nasyon ulit tayo."
"Being a silent supporter is hard specially if almost all of you're friends is against him, but He really keeps on proving me that voting and supporting him is not a mistake Congratulations APO BMM."
"This man is not just intellectual, you just know his heart to help our country. Thanks Toni for doing this interview. Not biased, not noisy and not judging. #BBMismyPresident"
"It all started in here..Toni was truly AMAZING! She‚Äôs a very strong and brave woman..she stood by him while others was scared to be cancelled.."
"It's incredibly great that I spend my 28 minutes watching this interview. He has a lot to tell us. He shows sincerity to serve the public. I love how he speak every words. There is a genuine feeling there. He is the best of all presidential candidates. I believe in him. #BBM #MABUHAY ANG PILIPINAS"
"Bumalik ako dito pagkatapos ko manuond ng Proclamation ni PBBM AYYYSS GRABE THANKYOUUUU TONI G.. DITO TALAGA NAG UMPISA MAMULAT ANG MGA TAO Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"
"This interview has started it all... it ignited the hearts of the Filipinos.."
"Ngayon ko lang pinanood. Di ko pa rin talaga kaya na hindi umiyak knowing how they were treated. But still chose to love the country. I only read books about them, and heard stories from my parents and grandparents. Nakakaiyak talaga."
"This is my 8th times watching this, im still teary eyes, the more i repeat watching the more i admire BBM, the most deserving presidential candidate for the philippines, like his father, thank you toni,very inspiring interview, im sure this is not my last time watching this kung pwede lng mag like uli, i lilike ko pa uli"
"It all started here. As an Ilocana, im so proud of you PBBM. You deserve to be our President. I am one of the 31m who stood and fought for you through social media. Naabutan ko pa ang panahon ng dad mo and i can say life before was so so much better. Everything was cheap, from electric bills down to basic needs. My parents are govt employees but i can say na hindi sila hirap noon and all praise sila sa magandang pamamalakad noon. I cannot √®ven spend my allowance during my elem years kasi libre na sa school ang merienda ng trigo, nutri bun busog ka na nun. At pag uwian may take home pa na klim na gatas at yellow corn powder na super sarap.."
"Even here at work, (which is a hospital in Bay Area, CA) when I say I‚Äôm Filipino they always tell me a story about Marcos. About how good he was when it was his time, (and I‚Äôm talking about patients  of mine are mostly elderly that knew our Philippine history) Alam nila the good things that happened when it was his regimen, I‚Äôm happy that Sir Bongbong won! Now I‚Äôm excited to visit our country again! Mabuhay Pilipinas!"
"Wow 15m views na, kulay pink pa suot,  congrats BBM, Sara! üáµüá≠"
"Mr. President, I know what they did to your father was unforgivable, but I know that you're bigger than them. From the bottom of my heart; I wish you all the luck, may God give you guidance in leading the country. Mabuhay po kayo at ang bansang Pilipinas!"
"I understand the luxury play of Marcos Sr. -He's trying to represent the Philippines to other countries that filipinos are not small and he stood up with Elegancy, Alpha Male. That they should come visit, do business and prosper together with the Philippines as the center. That was destroyed when small people with lack of vision provoked and misunderstood his play. We hoped to be a great Country again and many of us are here to support our new great president. May you be blessed with more wisdom as we welcome your family back and lead our Country."
"‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre making your enemies angry, then you‚Äôre doing a good job‚Äù - Bongbong Marcos 

I love that line‚Ä¶ hahahaha ayos! Kaya BBM for president Ô∏è"
"Keep being healthy PBBM and stay safe 'coz we, Filipinos are rooting for you. I am one of the Filipinos who believed, believes and will continuously believe in your capacity to become our leader. You have that dedication to serve the Philippines. Continue your father's legacy of making the Philippines a better nation. God bless you po. üáµüá≠"
"I do not know what really happened that time, but when I watch this I really feel that your Father did justify the true meaning of Leadership. We will support you all the way."
"From the start to end of this video, I get to know about him. He is so direct and has a vision to his countrymen. He is also a humble man. What strikes me the most is when he said ‚ÄúTo continue sense of nationhood. We were united as one. We‚Äôre all working in the same direction And we‚Äôve lost that a little bit‚Ä¶ I would like to restore that.‚Äù
Let‚Äôs keep the unity as one nation and someday the Philippines will be great and successful again Ô∏è."
"Watching this again after his first interview as a President with Toni Talks...amazing...I'm proud to vote for him Ô∏è"
"I NEVER GET TIRED OF LISTENING TO HIM! FULL OF WISDOM AND COMPASSION! PERFECT TO BE A PRESIDENT OF A COUNTRY OF COMPASSIONATE AND HARD WORKING HUMAN! PROUDER THAN BEFORE TO BE FILIPINO from Japan üáØüáµ!"
"No one else can bring back the Philippines to be a Great Nation again but BBM - The Son of the Best President that the Philippines has Ever had."
"He and his family  are just too good to be true..the mere fact that he and his family been able to handle such cruelty for such a long time,they remained humble and patient.if i where on their shoe i might be already inside a casket now. My vote for this man didn't went wasted and  is something that i did was right. I wish you and your family good health. May God bless you more for having a big heart not just for the few but for the entire Filipinos sir!! My full support will alwys be with your good governance.Ô∏è"

"Toni is awesome at it! Her listening skills is right on. She rephrase, she follow -up on what he says...and she ask the question based on what he just said then builds the story from that..."
"I'm still wide awake watching Toni Talks. It‚Äôs already 3:16am in California. I‚Äôm so sleepy and tired, but I can‚Äôt stop watching all her videos. I‚Äôve watched 10 videos already. Every video is so interesting and inspiring it made me cry a few times lol. Toni is truly very talented. She's gifted with great communication skills."

Luckily my last is Marcos and I'm proud of it."
"I love how he speaks about Filipinos in high regards. Parang nahiya ako to myself because i only see our negative traits. And that's usually what i also hear from other filipinos too. Bongbong is right, we need to reignite that nationhood we once had."
"I only watched this for the 1st time and I see now what I refused to see before. BBM has so much to be admired for. I see his brilliance, his sincerity, humility & more. 
I know that our country & our people will be in good hands under his Presidency.
It's a very beautiful interview."

"""Whatever your color is, you are still a Filipino."" I just watched it recently, and I must say that Congrats Mr. President, I hope you can really tell the true story amidst the lies because the truth will always prevail"
"One of the reasons of why i supported BBM-Sara last elections is their sincere and genuine love for the philippines.. yon lang naman ang gusto namin, mahalin natin ang pilipinas para sama sama tayong babangon..

sawa na kami sa away pulitika na sa huli, kakahanap ng masisisi e nalilimutan na ang pag unlad ng bansa.. this is our primary goal, paunlarin ang bansa at ipagmalaki ang pagka-Pilipino.. üáµüá≠üáµüá≠üáµüá≠"

Thank you Toni for standing the truth kahit alam mo na aalisin ka sa network nyo because you support Marcos, yun yung tunay napaninindigan sa katotohanan."
"I was not born in time of Marcos Sr. presidency, but I appreciate everything good he did for the Philippines."
"He was forgiven already and I know he has a sincere and humble heart for all.üáµüá≠"
"I got teary-eyed going to the last part of the interview I can see how real he is and his father was Knowing how other people criticized him (the Marcoses rather) I CAN REALLY SAY THAT THEY WERE WRONG BY THROWING THEM DIFFERENT WORDS.. I'm so happy that I voted him God bless you Mr. President and all of us Filipinos"
"Went to watch this again. I never regret voting for you! You'll do a good job as our President together with Inday Sara. Mahalin natin ang Pilipinas! Ô∏è"
"In my opinion, I think Ms.Toni‚Äôs channel theme is to inspire people through featured life stories nothing political. I hope everyone will respect this interview."
"As a first-time voter who voted last May 9, 2022, as well as someone who knows the truth about the Marcoses, it made me cry kasi the young people who's as old as me (or even younger than me) are part of the haters of his family kasi they believed in the repeated lies, which became the truth today. I have always saluted the perseverance of Pres. Marcos Sr., especially during the time when the opposition yearned for his step-down. How I wish the young people knew the truth about who the Marcoses really are, and not how they are depicted in history books, social media, and the news. Until now, I'm still so proud that I voted for Bongbong Marcos as the next president of the Republic of the Philippines. Marcos Forever!"
"This is the first time I've watched this and I can proudly say that I voted the right president. They can say all the things they want to say against him or his father but It's not going to change the way I see a person. I can see that he has a goal to help the Philippines and the Filipino people. God bless BBM and the Philippines."
"Right now, BBM is officially proclaimed as the 17th president of the Philippines! Mabuhay ka, Ginoong Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos Jr...."
"Watched this 2 times.

I'm backnto this interview after BBM won.And it still makes me cry talking about FEM and his words and how he was a leader,a husband and a Father."
"great to have this, learning the true Marcos. Hoping from you BBM, you will continue the vision of your father  - ""Maging great country again"""
"I personally like how he speaks. He seems like a person na kapupulutan ng aral. Wise. Iba kasi eh. There's something about his aura showing that he's truly intelligent. Tung tipong hindi pilit. Hindi pinangangalandakan. Natural. Walang bahid ng kaplastikan. Panahon na para mas lalaong yumabong ang mahal nating bansa. He is clear about what he wants for the country. He is not busy trying to pin down other ""enemy"" candidates unlike what others are doing. He is focused on his vision. I can imagine, he might be strict but it will be for the best. We all have this chance to choose this incredible man and change the course of our nation. I've always been embarassed when friends from other country asks me where I'm from. I never wanted to say I was Filipino. I gained back the sense of pride when PD30 sat on the position. Now I'm more than ready to raise our flag again. I am excited for the day I can fully and proudly say I am Filipino."
"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre tough not in that arrogant or aggressive way,we‚Äôre tough in a very gentle Asian way.The most remarkable quality that Filipinos have‚Äù.Very well said Pres.BBMCongratulationsmore power and GOD blessÔ∏è"

"I have seen this many times.I can sense as I listen  to him  the humility  he has.  He is a very respectful man..a loving father and a caring husband.

"so much emotion in this interview  despite to what happened to them, they are still kind and most of all they  love filipinos ..."
"Congratulations Mr. President.. ito ang nagpasimula ng lahat"
"I am happy because with this simple interview, this is where the freedom of Filipinos from lies begins. We have long been mired in poverty and problems, and I see this as one of the ways for everyone to know that not everything a good person says is true. It is unfortunate because the debate and asking for sympathy from the people is repeated just to cover up the lies, so that the truth will also come out. It may take years but the real story will come out so I‚Äôm happy. I enjoy listening to stories from aunts, uncles and even my grandmother about how highly foreigners think of our country. Good things done by the Marks and things that prove we can do something. It is unfortunate because those who have not experienced Martial Law, they are still the activists who become the branch to spread more lies. The truth will really come out and it is already happening. You are my vote in the coming election. With or without an interview."
"You can feel the sincerity in his words, and how genuine he is. Also the way he speaks, it's all coming from his heart especially when it comes to his family, I really admire and salute you Sir. BBMSARA tandem is the best Ô∏èÔ∏èüáµüá≠"

"Came back here after watching Maid In Malaca√±ang with BBM‚Äôs narrative of who his father was. It was portrayed well in the movie and I thought of this interview while watching it."
"How smart and articulated your words are."
"Went back to watch this Video as it shows how genuine He is. I watched all the interviews or documentaries for BBM whether it be from His critics or supporter. I noticed that the critics shows negative side and does not see how good he is. I understand that being a critic is showing the negative part of someone. Yet it should also be transparent and show the good side of the subject. So it can be called constructive criticism so that we can get better result from the documentaries/interviews. Thank you for this interview Miss Toni Gonzaga for showing his side and his personality."
"The Lord choose you to Lead this country, God bless you, pumila ako ng 6 hours just to vote for you and Sara, while watching this video my tears flow, dami ko na learn lalo na ang pagpakumbaba, God bless you and I'm standing in prayers for you our dearest sincere president,"

"The part that we never knew about the marcoses, i hope that everybody had pure heart and ears to listen what really happened that day"
"This is a must-watch interview of BBM! prepare yourself before watching by making your mind open."
"I really idolize you Miss Toni Gonzaga, because you don't just vlog here on youtube, you don't just interview artists or politicians, but you do interviews to give them a chance to hear their side As a human"

"Toni G you're indeed an example of a person of   good character and wisdom...i admire your kind of behavior which typifies a real filipina in the field of journalism and public discussion. You profess a well-educated and disciplined public icon in tv and elsewhere in other platforms. As a senior citizen and was born in FEM time i can definitely say that was the best time of my life. FEM had really instituted true discipline and love of our country whichbis exactly the opposite of his adversaries who wanted communism. i am proud to say that i am a product of Marcos era who lived in peace and harmony...where food is richly available at reasonable and affordable prices. i like his style of governance compared to the presidents of EDSA revolution who had duped the filipino youth of false accusations of the Marcos family. If FEM is not good for the agitators who had dabbed him as dictator, so be it. But young Marcoses should not be blamed for the father's misgivings."

That all the awful hearsays, bashes about the Marcoses, those that are transcribed from the books, boradcast in social media channels are very far, far  from the truth.

And as this video goes minute by minute, I just realized something new when ever he talks and he talk humbly. Dun ako napa wow.  When he talks, he has no yabang in him. He speaks with his heart and telling a story of his family and experiences in a humble way. That's when the time I got curious more about BBM and I watch mostly of his interview, vlog etc. I just found myself he is very inspirational when it comes to speaking. He is a natural speaker.

Also, I knew he's a good father, hearing from the stories of his own son. But sadly, some of us (Filipino people) doesn't know about it because of the lies and hatred from other people. And until now, even the youngest era of our time was manipulated by those lies. But seeing how President BBM manages all of this, I know that the truth will prevail because God have always fair judgement to good people."

"Iam just 26 at di pa ako buhay sa panahon ng mga marcos pero naikwento sa akin ng lola ko kung gaanu napakasaya mabuhay ng panahong namuno c ex president F. marcos kasi subrang napaka mura ng mga bilihin at madami pag kaka kitaan lahat ay sagana at walang mahirap bago paman dumating ang martial law Kaya lang naman nag ka martial law ay dahil sa mga nasa likod ng mga rebelde na ayaw ng tahimik na buhay at pilit na gustong umangat ng walang ka hirap hirap. Ang mga totoong utak talangka.at kaya lang naman madaming naabuso ang mga sundalo noong panahon ng martial law ay dahil sila rin ay naka tikim din ng mga pang aabuso sa kamay ng mga rebelde at di na hawak yun ni ex president F. Marcos kasi hindi nya kuntrolado ang bawat isang myembro ng sundalo. At sana naman wag puro bad side ng mga marcos ang tignan kasi naka lipas na yun at madami rin na gawang mabuti sa bansa si ex F. Marcos kung di lang naging gahaman sa kyamanan ang first lady emelda marcos sagana sana ang bansa ntin ngayon.pero kahit ganun paman naka lipas na ang lahat at ang mga naapektuhan at naabuso ng panahon ng martial law ay million million ang nakuha ng mga pamilya nila kaya sana naman mag move on na ang lahat sa usaping martial law. Hindi sa ako ay nag mama galing ako ay nag bibigay lang po ng opinion at nakikita ko na kailangan ng ating bansa ang magandang pamamalakad ng mga marcos nagawa na nya sa ilocos bakit d natin bigyan ng chance na baka magawa nya rin paunladin ang pilipinas,. Itigil na sana ang pambabatikos kasi matagal ng wala ang ex President F. Marcos at ang pag kakamali ng isa ay hindi pag kakamali ng lahat.

He seems like he‚Äôll make a passionate leader and president. You can tell their difference from the past work they did and their interviews. I registered to vote for him."

"The best thing that you can do is to help other people, to help other people as many as you can. FOR ME IT IS A WORD OF A TRUE SELFLESS LEADER!"
"I grew up hearing bad feedback about his father, they always using the martial law  against his father but, in reality former President Marcos did a lot of good things and improvement for our country. I hate how people only magnify what happened in martial law, but didn't mention Marcos contribution to our country."
"That being visionary is truly one of the best characteristics of being a great leader. No wonder Pres. Ferdinand Marcos is the best President that Philippines has ever had. Marcoses are the truest pure and kind hearted people. I can sense that they don‚Äôt have hatred to the people, but only the people who led and started the propaganda to instill hatred towards the Marcoses have made the people angry to them. It seemed the Marcoses were betrayed underground by using those influencial people especially religious sectors which that time were very persuasive."
"President Ferdinand E Marcos is the brilliant and best ever  president in the philippines walang makakatalo sa kanya kahit sino man...if bongbong marcos run for president my vote for him..."

"This History of Marcos are really overwhelmingly more and very challenging. A lot of things happen after Former President Marcos that makes the country drops to its knee of poverty and corruption and drugs business. None of this Politician make an effort or talk, they are all part of taking opportunity taking advantage of making rich of conspiracy business. I Thank all the people that works to make things learn and progress of showing the true makabayan. The country needs to be change completely from all levels. It is time for Bongbong to fulfill the long awaiting ambition of his Father for the Filipino to be a Maharlika. To Tony Gonzaga, you are really one of the best Blogger. Everything is a Plan for you to be in the part of History. God Bless You. Take Good Care Always as we are expecting more from you. Thank God.for being very natural and normal Filipino. I can sense something more in your way."
"The Marcoses knows their truth; that‚Äôs why you never see them on national television begging sympathy from the public. The way he answered all the questions, direct and sincerely, shows his honesty. Usually kasi andaming drama ng mga sagot, Kala mo laging inaapi sa interviews, puro parinig sa kalaban. Wala namang sense."

"Ngayon ko lang ito napanood. Matagal siyang naka save sa watch playlist ko. And naku-curious ako kung bakit madaming nagagalit kay Mam Toni, may school pa na gusto siyang kausapin. Pati friend ni Mam Toni,  nagsabi na firm ito sa decision na hindi na muling iboboto ang Marcos. She even uses ""#NeverAgain"". Pati ibang kaibigan ko nagre-react dito. Madaming nagiingay sa FB at Twitter na against kay Mam Toni."
"I was intrigued about the issue, so I watched it. Honestly, I see nothing wrong with it."
"Toni: What's your best quality?
BBM:  It's against my nature (proceeds to laugh) 
Authentic humility at its finest   a true quality of a leader. Not once did I hear him speak highly of himself and speak ill against other people. Doesn't promote hate peddling unlike those dilawans/anti-Marcos/propagandists who did nothing but hate, point fingers, and dwell on the kuno ""dark side of history"". First of all the "" sins of the past"" during Martial Law has been proven FALSE time and time again. There were no cases filed for the missing people or ""tortured ones"". The Martial Law was declared because there were growing threats of terrorist attacks, people were out of control, the oligarchs were controlling the land reform, groups were conspiring against the president (including Sisa and Ninoy Aquino). The severity of the situation at that time was the reason why Martial Law was declared. Without that law, we would have been like Afghanistan‚Äîterrorists being our leaders. Cory Aquino and the dilawans controlled the media and has their propaganda, heck they fooled people into believing Marcos was a bad president I included but not anymore. It's about time the truth comes out. Not the truth written in the history books by the dilawans but the real one. Thank you, FEM for your service and authentic care for the Philippines and thank you in advance to President Bong Bong Marcos for making the Philippines great again."

They witnessed the real and true history of Martial Law, he said, ""if you are a law-abiding citizen you will live peacefully, and if you are against the law then you are in trouble"". Pres. Marcos was a WWII veteran hero same with my father who fought against oppressors (Japanese and communists), and they will always be our heroes."

"THANK YOU SO MUCH TONI FOR GIVING HIM A CHANCE TO GIVE HIS WORDS OF WISDOM AND EXPERIENCES."
"The way Mr. BBM speaks is so sincere and it comes from his heart and mind, you can see how family Marcos loves all the Filipinos and our country as well, from what he shared, they never speak bad about their enemies, but instead they just focus on the work that needs to be done. Intelligent with the heart this is the kind of President that we need. #BBMismypresident2022 #votewisely."

She said that my lola got illness and needs an operation immediately but my lolo had no amount of money for the payment. He is only postman didn't had enough salary to pay the hospital bills. Because of his work, he decided to make a letter addressed to the office of the president and sent it to the office. After few weeks, my Lolo's  received the money.

"My parents left the Philippines during the Martial Law, we grew up here in the states. As growing up my thinking was that Marcos is a dictator portrayed by both Pinas and US mainstream media. After watching this interview and the backlash towards the host, it really dawn on me that the Marcoses are not bad at all. It showed that BBM's being a humble person. I think many doubters like myself had change my perception about the Marcoses. Thank to you Ms. Toni Gonzaga for that great interview. Mabuhay ang Pinas."
"We can't deny the fact that despite of issues  of his father still the Marcos are truely great servants, not only that they are smart and elegant."

"The very good thing I liked about Toni's vlogs is that the guest ALWAYS HAD THE FLOOR, unlike the other vlogs where the questions lead to certain issues that lead to the interviewer's own opinions. Congrats, Toni; you're really subjective!"
"In behalf of Lorenzo Nacu, my Lolo. We will support you all the way to the president. Lorenzo is the one who saved your Dad at the time of war. Your Dad find us and help all of us. We are your loyalist and we will bring the Philippines back to where it should be during your Dad's regime."

"By far the best interview I‚Äôve ever seen. No bias, no malice, no hidden agendas. There are 3 versions of the truth, the Marcoses side, the other side and the real truth. Many, if not all of the cases against them reached the supreme court were dismissed due to lack of evidence. What‚Äôs wrong with BBM saying that we deserve better than to be treated as 2nd class citizens; That filipinos are the best; That we need discipline. Do not let your hate overwhelm your humanity (taken from BBM‚Äôs interview with Erwin Tulfo)."

"I‚Äôm 35 years old now. Never voted for my entire life since wala akong interest sa politika. Dahil sa daming chika about this interview. Na curious ako. I‚Äôve watched and read videos/articles about this. Both anti and pro Marcoses. Pansin ko lang na puro accusations lang yung mga anti. Yung mga pro is may mga proof. Isama mo na yung mga statements nung mga dating Anti. And parang wala akong napanuod na nag bad mouth mga Marcoses sa mga kumalaban sa kanila. Na engganyo tuloy ako magparehistro. I‚Äôm just hoping na ituloy ni BBM yung pagtakbo niya na presidente. He will definitely get my first ever vote."
"I was crying while i‚Äôm watching him, he is really a true person. :‚Äô("
"I have grandfathers na part ng military time ng Marcos regime and they were always telling us stories of Marcos leadership.
Pero ang fave nilang ikwento yung time na handa na daw sila na pasabugin ang edsa but Marcos never gave them the go signal kahit pinipilit na ng chief of staff na pasabugin na, but it never came bec Marcos loved the Filipino people and would never wish harm to his countrymen."
"I always had a close encounter with sir bong bong back in 90's. Loyal customer namin sila sa ACA VIDEO greenhills. Very kind and patient yan.

I was able to watch Edsa 1 live telecast during that time.  I remember when Pres. Marcos was seating at the table and in front of him was then Chief of Staff Fabian Ver who was waiting for his instruction. Ver says they already got  two fighter planes flying now to strike at any time. However, Pres. Marcos order was not to attack. Even if there were lots of civilians gathered already, still his order was to disperse the crowd  without shooting them.  And if it is true that he was a dictator,  maybe those people who participated were long gone now.  And now, it's BBM's turn to prove his leadership!"

"Alam niyo napansin ko lang may isang ugali ang mga marcos o kahit si BBM lang, na hindi makuha ng karamihan satin lalo na ang mga kalaban niya sa politika. Yun ay ang maging laging kalmado sa lahat oras o hanggang kaya huminahon at kumalma, sobrang haba ng pasensya. Oo di ko inabot ang panahon ng tatay dahil bata pa rin ako 20yrs old only. Pero ayun ang pinaka napansin ko sa kanya since nung past 2016 election. Debate w/ other na running for VP laging kalmado kahit tirahan ng tirahin ng kalaban o kahit anong ibatong totoo man o hindi na sinasabi ng kalaban, kasi di natin alam ang nangyare noon katulad ko dko alam nangyare noon kasi syempre bata pa nga ako. Pero talagang nakukuha niya ang loob ng katulad ko kahit onti pa lang ang nalalaman ko, nababasa ko at nireresearch ko mga kabutihang ginawa nila sa bayan at bansa natin. Kahit mas marami ang nakikita at nababasa kong naninira sa kanila, ewan ko kung fake news ba o kwentong kutsero ba ang ibinabatong salita o binibintang sa kanila/pamilya niya. Pero still gustong gusto ko siya para sa bansa natin. Kumbaga kobinsadong kumbinsado ako sa kanya para manalo kahit ganon. Rehistrado nako nung 2019 at mag 21 this November at dati dko alam kung para saan at nagparehistro ako bilang botante, ngayon alam ko na kung para saan. Sa darating na eleksyon si sir Bongbong Marcos ang iboboto ko sa pagka presidente."
"I don't see anything wrong with the interview.   Bongbong Marcos is being true to his answers.  Toni did a great job as an intwrviewer.

"Nung Bata ko nabasa ko sa libro ng Araling Panlipunan na diktador daw po si late Ferdinand Marcos na masama daw siya. Kaya pag-uwi ko sa bahay nun tinanong ko ulit si lola at lola kung talagang masama nga si FM nuong siya ay presidente pero ang Sabi nila siya daw ang the best president Kasi nuon sobrang mura ng bilihin at may libre pa daw silang feeding. So Sabi ko kay lola bakit yung sa libro ganun ang sinasabi kay FM. At ngayon malaki na ako ngayon ko narealize na ang libro at media ay bias at di totoo mga sinasabi. This is a wake up call sa ating mga Pilipino na ang mga Marcos ang hindi magnanakaw at masama bagkus sila ang tunay na mabuti ang hinahangad sa ating mahal na Pilipinas. Kaya sir BBM kung tatakbo ka man po bilang Presidente next year nasa iyo po ang aking boto. I can see in your eyes the genuine and love for the Filipino people and the Philippines. Alam ko.magiging magaling kang presidente in the future katulad ng iyong yumaong ama.

Hindi tunog nakikipag debate. KUDOS to Toni!"
"I‚Äôve been reading all the comments. It seems like Toni has made such a huge impact on how the Filipino people are going to vote this time. Thank you Toni for being the catalyst in this seemingly complicated issue on who to vote, especially because a lot  of the Filipino people vote according to who‚Äôs popular or trending ( hint: Pambansang kamao). 
I hope the Filipino people will vote wisely this time. I was born before Marcos became president in 1969. The country was great back then, and then the Coquangcos took over. However, it was revealed that the oligarchs of Tarlac were actually corrupt and were being portrayed as victims when they were, and still are, villains. Ask the tenants of their hacienda. They will tell you of the killings. It‚Äôs about time that we vote wisely. Bangon Pilipinas!!!"

Yun ay yung napakadaming nasayang na panahon na sana naging mas better ang bansa, kung sana nabuksan na ang isip ng mga tao noon sana naging mas maayos tayo ngayon. Hindi ko naabutan ang panahon ni late Pres. Ferdinand Marcos, pero to think na hanggang ngayo  ay binabanatan pa din sya ng mga anti/kalaban nya ay isa lang ang ibig sabihin, naungusan nya lahat ng kalaban nya kaya galit na galit sa kanya or sa pamilya nya. Nakakalungkot lang kase nagpabulag ang karamihan noon sa panahon nya pero sabi nga lalabas at lalabas din ang katotohanan. Hindi pa huli ang lahat! BBM for President 2022!!!"

"People who doesn‚Äôt want a good change and good leadership are those who have personal interests of making money out of illegality.

You live in a democratic country; all opinions and actions are considered, as long as it doesn't harm people. So as Toni, she has the right to do this. Let me tell you that Toni have also made an interview from the opposite party, VP Leny Robredo, and no one bashed and made such ridiculous petitions against her. Is that what you think of equality and democracy: a filtered system? It's making me mad how you call yourselves ""wokes"" when you have a very bad perception of a very simple, easy-to-understand, situation like this."

"Ever since I got into ROTC, I never really fully believe what the books say about them. I mean how can we really believe with only one side of the story? Even the coin we are looking at has a different story. I always have this in my heart na ay may tinago to. Very biased lang kasi. I mean we don't really write a book and call it altogether factual if it's only one side of the story. It's always good to give a benefit of the doubt even if we are confronted with the truth. It's always good to step back for a while and see the whole thing with a different perspective."

Kung hindi dahil dito, hindi magiging trending ang pangalan ni sir Bong Bong at hindi magiging curious yung mga taong hindi siya kilala. Sure itong interview na ito, merong reason kung bakit nangyari  Thank you Toni for doing your purpose."

"The interview went well.  Politely, questions were answered smart, composed and with no drama.  This is a mere light conversation.  Toni Gonzaga handled it well, without pinpointing, accusing and pulling down the ""Marcos"" history. On the other hand, BBM answered the question direct to the point, without shaming or blaming others....
Simply, BBM wants to unite the nation again, he wants the Philippines great again and back to our own nationhood.  No body can answer the way BBM did in this interview. I commend you BBM and Toni."
"This is a brilliant interview. Toni is a brilliant interviewer and BBM is an intelligent & charismatic subject. Both are well spoken, Toni made it look easy to segue from one subject to the next. This is not intended to be a hard hitting political take down piece. The interview was structured well by starting from when he was a child until his father‚Äôs death then segued into his vision for the future. She‚Äôs so good, the interview flowed seamlessly. His father‚Äôs ‚Äòsins‚Äô are not his sins. This is an interview about a son who loved his father. Who are we to judge? Great job Toni. Brilliant."

"I don't know why but this interview just made me cry. That ""final look"" that BBM was talking about really impacted me.

It‚Äôs so sad to hear that last look you can see from your loved one passing away will be in him forever."
"This is one of the best interview by miss Tony G. Naalala ko pa sabi ng mga parents ko ibang iba nung panahon ni Marcos. Walang maraming mahirap. At isa sa pinakamayamang bansa ang Pilipinas.

"I remember those times when my lolo and lola are still alive, lagi nilang pinagtatanggol sakin ang mga Marcos. I always hated our late President Ferdinand Marcos because that's what they taught us at school. Lagi akong nakikipagtalo sa mga grandparents ko noon one time nasabihan ako ng lola ko ""Wag mo akong turuan na parang nabuhay ka ng mga panahon ni Marcos, kami ang nakakita, kami ang nakasaksi"" then little by little I was enlightened and those learnings that I thought was true, it was all manipulated by those who won after Marcos. Grabe! Nung mga time na yun I felt like my whole childhood was a lie, I felt like I was cheated. But now, not anymore. Now I fully understand what my parents and grandparents are trying to tell me. Ngayon ang pangarap ko nalang maranasan din ang klase ng pamumuno na pinagmamalaki ng mga magulang at lolo't lola ko."

Our country are rich in all form. Minerals, Skilled workers in short all the resources we already had. If i could bring back to that year i will choose him as my president. quoted See that how marcos did back in the century. I hope this time every Filipino would choose the visionary type of a leader and if BBM will run as president I will vote for him. The quality of a real leader i saw from him he was mold by his father experiences he had a point that you can never please anybody to like you. Toni thank you for sharing this kind of good content.

"""If you're making your enemies angry, You're doing good job."" Thats what smart people do."
"Just sharing.  I started being curious about the late Marcos  when I started working here in Manila . Probably  about 3x a week (esp. during the  workweek ,bec.  usually I ride a taxi when it's difficult to take the train or bus), I'll share this random conversation with manong taxi driver and from my observation, they seem to always  mention how ""life"" was easier  or ""better"" during the Marcos regime. Of course, I am living in the era where the reality is ""Filipinos hated the outcome of the Martial Law"" or should I say the ""Martial law"" so I couldn't really comment on what was being said that time  by the taxi driver. But you know, come to think of it, these taxi drivers must have gone through or have seen a lot to say such things. So since then, I've started to watch the late Marcos videos, speeches ( well, hindi ko naman napanood pa lahat ) .. and read few articles about him and I realized, there are good things that happened to our country during his time that wasn't written on our elementary or high school books ( or pwede din kasi sa school lang namin yun ) .. So since then, I try to keep an open mind,  everything that's written or reported these days are 100% inaccurate.  I so do wish, every concerned citizen will think the same and refrain from making snap judgements just because the tree bore a yellow or a red fruit.  Thank you po Ms. Toni for having a balance platform. God Bless you!"

Kahit walang connection sa subject at lesson, ang tinuturo ng mga prof namin ay tungkol sa martial law at anti-marcos. Kapag pumalag ka sa mga sinabi nila na against kay marcos, bagsak ka kaya shut up na lang kami. Ang daming kabataan ang na-brain wash ng mga state universities at private kasi simula elementary palang sila ay tinuturuan na sila ng mga mali. Kaya tama yung sinabi ni BBM na lies become truth. Kaya kapag nanalo siya napresident sana mabago ang mga nakalagay sa libro at maling tinuturo na masama ang marcos. My parents and relatives mismo kinikwento samin kung gaano kaganda dito sa pilipinas noong panahon ni Marcos kasi naexperience nila at nasira lang dahil sa mga Aquino at mga dilawan."

"Kahit sobrang daming paninira, never silang nagsabi ng masama laban sa mga kalaban nila. They stayed quiet and humble. Kahit sa interview na to. Samantalang yung kabila pag ininterview puro na lang paninira at pagbubuhat ng sarili nilang bangko. Dun palang makikita mo na kung anong klase silang tao. Usually yung mga taong humble, they are so calm kasi alam nila yung truth. And those people na naninira, they are so desperate to look like they are the innocent ones so they pretend to deceive people."

"Bongbong Marcos is such a humble guy! May he be the next President of the Philippines amen!"

"their VISION for the Philippines is the most important thing that the other competitors doesn't have. And I think BBM have that all the time. Naghahanap kayo ng mga nagawa nya and natatawa ang mga anti-Marcos kasi di makapag bigay ng mga nagawa or contribution si BBM sa bansa, pero tingnan nyo nman naging experiences nya, sa murang edad pa lang..mulat na sya sa realidad na nangyayari sa palasyo at politika. Marami syang natutuhan hindi lang sa pag-aaral pati sa leadership na meron ang tatay nya. Hindi tulad ni Fuchsia pink na nabyuda lang nagka ambisyon nang maging pangulo. Mula noon hanggang ngayon walang pinagbago sa plataporma nya kundi puro tungkol sa pagiging ina ng bansa at pagtulong sa mahihirap, paano nman yung mga paraan mo para matulungan sila?? Anong mga icocontribute mo para makatulong sa kanila at mawala ang kahirapan sa bansa??

I still want to prove if it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôve been against Duterte kase naman hindi siya nakikinig at hindi pa agad binan yung travel especially nung time na mag spread na yung covid pero may mga gusto parin akong nagawa niya. Pati sa Marcoses ang dami kong narinig na masasama at pinaniwalaan ko yon hanggang sa yon nalang yung katotohanan na alam ko. These past few I‚Äôve been hearing about people and reading some comments bashing Toni kase dahil sa interview. Fan parin ako ni Toni kahit pa iba yung i-support niya sa sinu-support ko. Kaya ganun nalang tingin ko sa mga tao na nagagalit kase si Toni in favor kay Bong Bong Marcos and I think that‚Äôs fine because we have the freedom of speech and expression so we don‚Äôt have the right to tell someone on what to do. Everyone has the right to choose. Then I‚Äôm watching some foreigners especially korean who‚Äôs making fun of Filipinos dahil accent or educational system. Paano naman idi-discriminate eh kahit tayo pinagtatawanan natin sarili nating accent at baliw na baliw sa kpop. Pero naisip ko at some point may katotohanan naman sa sinasabi nila. About sa economy natin pati bilihin. Kaya naisip ko na panoorin tong interview ni Toni kay BBM. I have a lot of realizations. I‚Äôm thinking of voting him as a president in 2022 but I will still continue to search for more information pa."

There's a lot of projects like the schools, hospitals, roads, bridges and other essential establishments - all for the Filipino people"

During his time, your country was one of the richest countries in the world. Her comments made me speechless."
"A man who is sharing his childhood memories. How kind and loving his father was and how he see his father as a man whom he is proud of."

As a young adult, I grew up believing that Marcos made the lives of the Filipinos hard because of Martial Law, but upon listening to the testimonies of the ones who first handedly experienced the Marcos Regime and through research, my perception turned to 180¬∞."

Grabe out of nowhere, napaiyak nalang talaga ako kasi since my elementary days, puro kasamaan nya yung tinatanim ng turo ng libro sa isip ko.I remember my english/history teacher who was once against the lesson in the book that contains disproved issues and criticisms about FEM, she just told us, ‚ÄúACTUALLY NAABUTAN KONG NAGING PRESIDENTE SI FEM, AND ISA LANG MASASABI KO, HE WAS A GREAT LEADER, OUR ECONOMY WAS GREAT AND ALL THE FILIPINOS WERE DISCIPLINED.‚Äù And because of that, curiosity starts to grow in my head. But now, I realized that truths just came out naturally. Respect my comment guys. NO HATE NA SANA. JUST STOP THE HATE NALANG AND RESPECT EACH OTHERS OPINION.

"Why am I rooting for BBM? Because my mom told me about my grandfather's story. He was a farmer, one of the farmers who benefited in PFM's Agrarian Reform Program. FM takes care of farmers. He had the IRRI, where  experts study how to produce quality rice and have an abundant harvest. Another thing that my mom told me, our brgy during her elementary days didn't have electricity, my grandfather, along with other men from our brgy wrote a letter to then First Lady Imelda Marcos, about the situation.  Imagine, it was a snail mail written to FL who at that time was Minister of Human Settlements, the letter was handwritten, they didn't have typewriter, yet after 3 weeks, people from Meralco came and a few days after, our barangay had electricity. This is my mom's personal experience. Would she invent this story? Of course not.  Nowadays, can we communicate with higher government officials that easily? I don't think so, but during FM's time, a letter sent by a group of farmers, was given importance and their problem was given a solution."

"I studied in UPLB and strong anti Marcos talaga ang UP. One of the propaganda is to instill to the minds of the people that the Marcos regime was the worst. So our Professor made us interview people in nearby barangays in Laguna to interview them what life was like during Marcos, being so young and naive I was expecting negative comments. But I was wrong, like 1 out of 10 lang yung negative. Lahat puro good feedback during Marcos time. I can even remember interviewing this one security guard, I can sense his pride on his stories. Super proud daw mga tao noon to be called Filipinos because of how great our nation was. I remember presenting this assignment as a report in front of my class, in the middle of my presentation my professor cut me. He instead refocused the conversation on the usual - how terrible life was during Marcos time. I was so naive during that time and didn't even think about this. Pero now I realized, grabe pala talaga na twist ang facts. I'm from Bicol and I grew up hating the Marcos but now I know better."

Kaawa awa HINDI si  Bongbong Marcos kundi TAYONG mga Pilipino. Sabi ng lolo ko nung time ni Marcos proud Pinoys tayo. Itong interview makikita mo ang napaka talinong pakikipag usap. Saka hindi centered sa sarili at paninira sa iba kundi para sa pangkalahatan ang laging goals niya. Ewan ko nalang talaga sa mga nabubulagan padin until now na akala mo pinanganak nung panahon ng regime ni PFEM para manghusga."

You see, bbm kase there's weight to every words he said, enlighting actually. His answers was all pure and natural walang halo, it was even as if he was happy reminiscing his past days with his father parang normal conversation that you would normally tell to someone."

"The way he speak , he's very smart and straightforward. Hindi mo makikitaan ng uncertainty. He is very sure of every word that he utters."
"Idk why. But Marcos seems really sincere..
I want to hate him like what others says but, really.. he seems light, sincere..the concern is there..  you can feel the way he speaks, the body language..straightforward.. and the thought of the late Mirriam Santiago chose him, that means something..
goodjob to Toni for interviewing him.. even subscribed to Toni because of this interview."

- Late President Marcos.

Right! I see the logic if the late President Marcos is a true dictator . Magiging madugo ang People power sa history ng Pilipinas because the power of the army is in the hands of the president."
"I am praying for a good time that he really become a president and fulfill the dreams that his father failed to continue to do when he was alive, even so the late President Marcos was and still is up to now the best president of the Philippines üáµüá≠ for me."
"God will never cancel you Toni. Do what you believe is right and just."
"New generations were being blinded with the truth about Marcos leadership.  This time around, as an ordinary citizen, it will be a great honor for me to vote for Bong Bong to show my appreciation to his father.  I think it is not fair to say bad things on him.  He is a different person.  He is the only presidential candidate who doesn‚Äôt throw any shades to any candidates we have - for me this is one of the many traits of a good leadership.  If you guys wanted to associate marital law with Bong, well, I was born during martial law and all I could say it was the best Philippines we have.  1986 onwards, the country tumbles down economically and made the country from best to worst.  Philippine history needs major correction.  These are my personal thoughts.  Peace"
"Since I was born,MARCOS SUPPORTER na ako,my first vote was  for Late Pres Marcos,2nd was for Tatay Digong and I'm sure if God's willing,my 3rd vote will be for BBM in presidential seat,last 2016 BBM is my VP.
Di ako bumoto don sa mga ibang nagdaang pangulo.
Proud to be the first student who tested the nutribun ,I was in Grade 6 that year in Mindanao,in Gensan."
"BBM lng ang politician na kilala ko never nagsalita ng masama sa kapwa even what happened to his family... Tunay na matalino dahil ginagamit ang pinagaralan sa salita at sa gawa. And BBM is a good son brother husband and a father so i can tell he can be a better best president to anyone. Totality of his personality im sure his a good person w a good heart, thank you ms toni for guesting BBM,"

"Pag naging Presidente ng bansa si BBM, saka pa lang ulit siguro ako magiging proud maging isang Pilipino. Sana nga manalo ka sir!"
"I asked my 94 year-old grandfather kung ano masasabi niya tungkol kay Marcos. He said that maganda daw ang pamamalakad noon. He even said na magaling daw na president c Marcos. I also asked him about the martial law at sabi ni grandpa hindi naman daw buong Pilipinas ang may martial law during that time. Yun lang daw mga places na magulo. Hindi naman daw nakakatakot noon kahit may martial law."

"pumunta ako dito to educate myself. aside from it, nagpaiyak pa pala AHAHA  he's an intelligent man."
"Just remember, Toni has the right to interview whoever she wants to interview. There‚Äôs no need for backlash if you don‚Äôt like the interviewee. The point of interviews are so the people can listen and make their own judgment. 

Toni asked very professional questions. She interviewed Leni and other politicians, it‚Äôs only reasonable to interview BBM too."
"What a beautifully-hearted person Bongbong is! Sana siya na, if it's God's Will! SO BE IT!"
"Ms. Toni, please know that what you've that with this interview is purely expressing the freedom of every Filipino. Freedom of speech. Don't feel bad, people will always have something to say about you especially if it is something they don't like but just do you."
"We appeal for part 2, Miss Toni! I enjoyed watching this video. When sir Bong bong said that his father is a real leader and has a vision, he meant it. He knows how his father works and it shows his admiration for his father.  It‚Äôs not making sense why people hated this video, but I can tell most loved it! More views as compared to Leni‚Äôs interview. Haha this has more sense  on our part, this interview is fair."
"""If you're making your enemies angry you are doing a good job."""
"Just a 28 minute interview, but learned lifelong wisdom..."
"The best part of this interview is for BBM to look back into his training as a young child. Ganun dapat ang parents: they show what they do to their kids, and ask for an opinion from them like an adult! I mean, it will make kids learn to think critically for themselves when they grow up! Magandang pamantayan sa magulang ang isinasali ang mga anak sa iyong trabaho para may ideya sila. Ngapala napansin ko English ni sir: Laking UK nga... hehehe... Imbes na sabihin when I was sick, yung when you are ill... typical British. Hehe. Pero I think beyond his stay sa UK hindi iyon ang rason kung bakit very charming si BBM. Charming ang life nila as a family. I had the privilege of visiting the original residence of his dad in Batac: You would seriously doubt the veracity of plunder against the entire family because I just saw a simple home. Typical working class old wooden furnitures, mga crochet curtains.. then coming inside Marcos' room parang I smelled a hint of intelligence. This interview resonates that feeling about how Apo Lakay was as a man: typical single minded visionary. Mga war relics lang nakita ko noon. Hindi mahilig mag hoard si Apo Lakay ng mga luxury items. And if you watch his dad's interviews: he is not a palaaway, very forthright sumagot ng tanong (and sometimes remarkably witty.) May Alpha traits kumbaga. So BBM is lucky not to have a smart dad. But a dad, who is truthful, who has nothing to hide. By the way, I do not want as much to incite this but people do not know that a large tract of land from the Marcoses is a State University. Yes, Marcos was brave because he is not scared to educate people! Corrupt politicians sensationalize and fabricate truths and are terribly terribly horrified to lead a nation of people who think. Yan na. The truth is always self evident. It does not need to talk even. (Tamaan mga maingay na puro pukol ginagawa... ehehehe.)"
"Ang gaan ng interview na to. Haaay, don‚Äôt mind the haters. Ito yung manok ko for president. Ang bait ng awra niya Ang gaan niya kausap. Yung habang nagsasalita siya mapapatitig ka habang nakikinig."
"My take on this Interview is that, Toni only showed in a subtle manner who Bongbong really is, as a Person. A good natured and meaningful interaction. If the Interviewer were the likes of Korina Sanchez, it would have geared to Politics and Marcos regime. Bongbong only has praises for his Dad because after all, he is his father's Son who look up to his Dad and witnessed how he worked hard on his position and he only elaborated the priviledged life they had, depicted as children of the President. And a Son as he is, Bongbong and his Dad are still two different people. Bongbong demonstrated no cynicism and no loathing for people who judged them for their Last Name. Because true to that, No Politician will never be criticized whether he do good or bad. He only uttered factual occurence. Never bad mouthed anyone. Having the priviledge to study and live in the West, he is even more Filipino than those Filipinos I know who also had the opportunity to study and live abroad. Bongbong Marcos is an eloquent, spontaneous, optimistic and an Intellectual man. In this Interview, we came to know who Bongbong Marcos really is. He is a man with substance, with conviction, dignified, has morals and Integrity."
"When people cancelled toni, because of this interview, while they did not reacted to other toni's interview with the politicians, dun mo tlga makikita ang pagkabias, first time voter here (29 years of existence) and I will vote for you sir, nagparegister talaga ako for you.

"After watching both interviews, it only shows who is more capable of being on the position of presidential and who‚Äôs not.  Let‚Äôs vote wisely. Who doesn‚Äôt just want a revenge for the marcoses or duterte. Someone who can change or improve for the betterment of our country. Someone who shows a platform that will uplift the Filipino people.

Very simple question of Toni  in a moderate way was answered by Bongbong . Flowing happiness from His heart how he  honored, respect, proud & love his father the way he was brought  up  & become  what he is now was coming from his heart. What is wrong of that dilawans. 30 years never stopped accusing Pres Marcos of LIES. You all know the truth that  your LIES is NOT  TRUE . The truth is Ninoy Aquino & Jomar Sison are partners in Crime they are the LEADERS of NPA, CDD & NDF. And Sison is living in another country in a very comfortable life & trying to manipulate how he can come back & make the Philippines a Communist country.  And this dilawans because they are greedy of Money they follow whatever Jomar Sison wants because of Money. MONEY & MORE money. You are all PATHETIC dilawans.

"My tears suddenly fall down as I heard the words, ""I had spent my whole life defending the Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now."" I see a heart of being a father to the nation. At naranasan ko ang pagiging tatay ni FEM sa mga bata sa Pilipinas dahil I was born in 1985 & the following years until FEM stepped down from Malaca√±ang naranasan namin na nakaluwag sa buhay dahil may support ang pamahalaan na mga 1st class na gatas, csm, bulgor at nutri bun. Papa ko farmer nakaranas ng kaginhawaan sa pagsasaka dahil sa Masagana program ng pamahalaan. Ang nangyaring rally noon kahit nga hanggang ngayon sa Manila lang naman naganap hindi nman ngrally buong Pilipinas. Yung mga nagrarally di naman supporter ng pamahalaan yan. Sa simula pa lang anti government na mga yan. Kahit sino presidente ilagay sa pwesto may magrarally pa rin kasi nakadikit na sa kanila ang masamang espiritu ng pagka rebellious na pag may hindi gusto sa pamamalakad ng pamahalaan gusto lagi idaan agad sa pag aalsa, sigawan at dahas at alam niyo po namamana at namamana yang masamang espiritu na yan sa sunod pang henerasyon kaya be careful po kayo dahil di po mabuting espiritu ang maipapamana niyo once mainvolve kayo sa isang pag aalsa. In the book of Romans chapter 13 says.. Submit to Government, ""Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God‚Äôs minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God‚Äôs minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience‚Äô sake."""

His father got sick because of the emotional pain. Imagine spending your life to serve people who later on want to oust you.

"OMG! All BBM said were true. I was in the palace before the Marcoses left for Hawaii. During the time i was there, we asked he soldiers there,  why was it that Marcos allowed the rally in Edsa, the soldier, Marcos, doesnt want to hurt the filipino people. Im having goose pimple now as i reminisced it, The soldier told us, that in few seconds, Edsa would be cleared, had the President order to. Ilang minuto lng daw ubos ang tao sa EDSA sa isang utos lng ni Marcos, pero di pumayag  si Mracos. Yan and di alam ng tao at yan ang ayaw nila paniwalaan, hatred ang nangibabaw sa tao, ultimo mga taong di naabutan ang Martial Law, galit! Grabe! Para sa akin, si Marcos pa rin ang pinaka magaling na Philippine President. Mga nasa ilalim nya ang namantala sa position and thats inevitable, Di  alam ni Marcos lahat ng galaw ng mga nasa ilalim nya, Sana, matuto ang tao na maging bukas abg isipan, Hindi puro galit. Mabuhay ka BBM! God bless your political career. I believe you very much, and definitely will support you. MABUHAY ka po!"
"Thank you Tony for this! I was mad at Marcos Family when I was teen. Studying at school hearing bad things about Marcos. But when I was able to search on my own. All pages I found is that Marcus was the best President we have ever been. Lahat nagawa nya para sa Pilipinas. I dont know! Why, sinisiraan nang sobra! But now! I know marami ang nagising sa katutuhanan. !! Marcos for 2022"
"Dati, ayaw na ayaw ko sana sa iyo, Toni, but seeing & listening to this very professional & unbias interview you did with BBM, eh, pinahanga mo ako ng sobra-sobra.  Napasubscribe na rin tuloy ako sa channel mo.  Ang galing-galing mo, Toni, and certainly is our soon-to-be President, BBM...."

Bigla akong naluha sa sinabi ng Boss ko bigla akong nahiya sa sarili ko..."
"Bongbong Marcos speaks from the heart. You can see the sincerity in every words he says. He showed how real and intelligent he is as a person and a leader."
"The greatest thing I have heard and learned from this gifted son of former President Ferdinand Marcos is this:""The best thing that you can do is to help other people. Is to help many other people. As many people as you can.  And what else can you do better than that? I can't think of anything that one could do better than that ."" Amazing! A very profound  spiritual insight expressed in a very simple manner! Wow!"
"Dalangin ko kay God,  gabayan po kayo, President Bongbong Marcos, at lagi po kayo ingatan, sa lahat ng hakbang ng inyong buhay. Lagi kayo bigyan ng Panginoon ng Kalakasan. At kaligtasan ng inyong buong Pamilya. Salamat sa sakripisyo, para maunlad ang Bansang Pilipinas Ô∏è"
"Nothing wrong with this interview, so many lessons learned , we need part 2"
"When I was a student, Edsa 1 has always been labeled as a ""peaceful revolution"", with all of the facts coming in, it seems that the reason why it was peaceful was because the commander in chief instructed his armed and capable army to not hurt the Filipinos, the same people he defended his whole life."
"Naiyak ako bigla  ‚Äú I have spent my whole life defending Filipinos. I cannot hurt them now. Put your guns down and we‚Äôre not shooting anyone.‚Äù"
"I‚Äôm no fan of Toni Gonzaga but I never get tired of watching her interview with BBM. Her questions are simple and are not penetrating, like other journalists are are doing. She was able to bring out the human side of BBM. Like BBM my eyes swell with tears when she asked the last moment of FEM.

"An Eye Opener interview! Im a millenial, buong akala ko and maybe they instill it in our young minds in textbooks elementary and high school that marcoses are bad guys, then when i go to college in state university we have minor subject in political science and the first topic is philippine history,our professor really explain the real history with an open mind without reading textbook or a reference, nagkwekwento lang talaga sya, and im so amazed. Na may mga bahagi ng kasaysayan na noon ko lang narinig. that's the time na nagkaroon ako ng open mind to listen, research and study what really happens in our history.We support late Sen. Miriam Defensor last election and i believe her saying that BBM as her VP is deserving and can be a brilliant president of our country!"
"There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this interview. Made me cry when He is remembering his dying father, how he looked at before passing away. Honestly that moment was both pain and hapiness, undescribable feeling. I could relate as i have lost my brother last month, how pain will never ever go away but you‚Äôll live with it. This interview focused more about His life,a son, a husband, a father and a little bit of how he is as a politician being a Marcos. Neither they stole a money from the people, we have no right to judge as we aren‚Äôt God who is rightful."
"This is the kind of leadership we need. A leader that unites and not to divide.

During Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore and Marcos time after World war 2 sila ang nag restore at build ng Kanilang bansa in a similar way. They are both strict in a sense that can govern their nation. But for me Base on what i search, a long time of searching and keep asking for the truth bakit ang hirap maging Filipino, ang baba ng tingin sa Filipino this period of time. I felt relieve, now i have the answer. Thanks, hope for the best Philippines"
